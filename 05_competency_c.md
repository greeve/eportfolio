The third core competency is to ["recognize the diversity (such as cultural and economic) in the clientele and employees of an information organization and be familiar with actions the organization should take to address this diversity"](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/current-students/courses/core-competencies).

As technological advancements and societal progress expands our knowledge about the world and its inhabitants one becomes increasinly aware of the diversity that exists in the world. 

Diversity can be found in various aspects of clientele or employees within a library or information organization. 

Patrons and employees vary in appearance, phyiscal ability, ethnicity, cultural backgrounds and norms, immigrant status, religious affiliation, gender, education, employment, economic status, and housing. 

In addition to recognizing the diversity that exists within patrons and employees is the need for information organizations to act in ways that help them better understand and reflect this diversity. 

The ALA Policy Manual for diversity states:

"Libraries can and should play a crucial role in empowering diverse populations for full participation in a democratic society. In order to accomplish this, however, libraries must utilize multivariate resources and strategies. In the library workforce, concrete programs of recruitment, training, development, advancement and promotion are needed in order to increase and retain diverse library personnel who are reflective of the society we serve" (ALA Policy Manual, 2016). 

Experiences within the SJSU School of Information MLIS program reinforced the need to recognize and reflect the diversity that eixsts among an information organization's patrons and employees. 

A discussion post in LIBR 200 about professional library associations demonstrates an understanding of the value of giving information organizations and information professionals a support network where they can meet others doing similar work but from the context of their own diverse background and circumstances.

An essay assignment in LIBR 204 examined qualities of a great leadership by looking at the experience and work of a leader within the library and information profession. 

Research for this assignment led to understanding that diversity within a team becomes an asset and advantange when the team works towards a unified goal. 

Helping to meet the needs of blind patrons was the focus of a discussion posting in LIBR 210. 

This posting shed light on the need to recognize patrons within minority groups and the broader issue of how an information organization can best meet the needs of these underserved populations.

A semester-long strategic planning project in LIBR 204 about an existing public library revealed the need for information organizations to develop cultural competency to help them better serve their diverse communities (Evans and Ward, 2007, p. 46). 

## Evidence

The following evidences from previous course work demonstrate an understanding of the diversity among patrons and employees of information organizations as well as actions that can be taken by the organization to reflect that diversity.

1. A discussion post about the value of diverse backgrounds and experience coming together within professional associations.
2. An essay about great leadership demonstrating the value of diversity in helping groups accomplish great things.
3. A discussion posting about meeting the needs of underserved populations. 
4. A strategic planning project showing the diversity within a public library.

### [LIBR 200 Discussion post: Professional Library Associations]()

Professional Library Associations give information professionals an opportunity to join a community where they can share ideas, solutions, best practices, job experiences, and job openings. 

Researching about these associations and writing a discussion post on the research findings demonstrates the diversity present in a professional association and how this diversity can lead to improving everyone. 

Although the community shares a similar set of professional interests and pursuits the network of information professionals come from diverse cultural and economic backgrounds. 

Associating with information professionals from diverse backgrounds and settings gives opportunities to learn from each other and see new perspectives that were previously unknown or unfamiliar.

Information organizations can encourage their employees to join and participate in a professional library association. 

This encouragement promotes the value and benefits of diversity to the organization's employees and its surrounding community by ensuring more broadly skilled and trained professionals who effectively serve the needs of the community.

### Evidence 2

An information organization faces the challenge of uniting a diverse group of professionals around a shared vision all can support and trust. 

Great leaders exhibit the qualities that unite a team or organization around a common purpose and vision. 

They put the mission of the organization first before themselves or anything else. 

This assignment looked at the leadership qualities exhibited by Daniel J. Cohen the current executive director of the [Digital Public Library of America (DPLA)](http://www.dp.la).

Cohen has spent most of his professional career on digital and computer technology-focused initiatives and projects. 

Like a film director leading a diverse group of professional staff to create a unique and worthwhile film, Cohen directs projects with "a core belief that large-scale initiatives involving technology are actually *social* projects. That is, successful digital projects mainly involve getting diverse people working together towards an ideal" (Enis, 2013). 

Researching and writing about Cohen shows that diversity can be an asset in accomplishing group projects and tasks rather than an obstacle.

Rather than ignoring diversity that exists within an information organization Cohen respects and embraces that diversity knowing that it will lead to creating a better product and service. 

### Evidence 3

### Evidence 4

## Conclusion

Libraries and information organizations stand in a unique position to understand, embrace, and reflect this diversity. 

Similar to Cohen, the work of an information professional is social in nature working with other professionals and with patrons of the organization.

It involves working with people from diverse appearance, age, economic status and backgrounds in a way that acknowledges, respects, and celebrates this diversity. 

When diversity is understood, appreciated, and embraced the service of information professionals demonstrate the value that a group is stronger because of it's diversity not in spite of it.

## Notes 

A core ideal within library and information science is to provide equal access to information for everyone regardless of the differences that exists within society. 

The idea of diverse backgrounds and experiences helps see things in new ways that can help solve problems that weren't understood previously. (See things as they are not as we want them to be)
