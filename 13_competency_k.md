# Competency K

The eleventh competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to ["design instructional programs based on learning principles and theories"](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/current-students/courses/core-competencies).

The proliferation of information in today's society is reaching levels never seen previously in recorded history. This rising tide of information coupled with advancements in computing and internet technologies is transforming the way learning and instruction are conducted. Attempting to teach the breadth and depth of human knowledge becomes a futile effort. The goal of teaching and instruction must be to help learners learn how to learn so that they are motivated to become life-long learners. Research progress in the study of the mind has created a "cognitive revolution" giving new insights to how individuals learn and understand (Simon, 2000, p. 116). "[T]he meaning of "knowing" has shifted from being able to remember and repeat information to being able to find and use it" (National Research Council, 2000). Instruction and learning must elevate to become more active and involved that creates deep understanding and experience. Efforts to increase the amount of asynchronous instruction and learning in the classroom (including the flipped classroom approach) are examples of striving to elevate the effectiveness of instruction and learning. Example-based teaching, creating learning environments where discovery and exploration is fostered, and helping learners visualize new concepts and ideas are other examples of new approaches to instruction and learning in today's information age. Coursework in the SJSU MLIS program provided opportunities for designing instructional resources based on learning principles and theories. 

## Evidence

The following projects and assignments demonstrate examples of designing instructional programs based on learning principles and theories. 

1. Instructional screencast for creating a web map
2. Instructional screencast for using a library database
3. Discussion post about flipped classrooms
4. Library guide about web mapping

## Conclusion

Just as traditional modes of instruction and learning are adapting and changing the approach information organizations take towards instruction and learning must also adapt and change. 

One scholar noted that "[a]s faculty and students increasingly use the Web for teaching, research, and scholarly communication, the libraryâ€™s traditional patterns of service delivery, including bibliographic instruction (BI), are called into question" (Ladner, Beagle, Steele, & Steele, 2004, p. 329). 

With this new understanding there is an increased need to use assessment more fully to ensure that instruction and learning matches the needs and preparation of today's learners (LaGuardia, 2012, p. 603).
