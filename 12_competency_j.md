# Competency J

The tenth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to ["describe the fundamental concepts of information-seeking behaviors"](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/current-students/courses/core-competencies).

Information seeking and information behavior are terms referring to human behavior that is so fundamental and commonplace that it can easily go unnoticed. 

These terms refer to the "common human cycle of needing, looking for, choosing, and using information of some kind" (Case, 2008, p. 35). 

Information seeking behaviors begin with the information user or patron and their information need (Wilson, 1981). 

The patron recognizes that their knowledge and understanding about a subject is inadequate to achieve some result or goal.

Information seeking behaviors are studied from a variety of perspectives including occupation, role within society, and demographics (Rubin, 2016, p. 373).

## Conclusion

- Deluge of information in today's interconnected society. 
- Librarians and information scientists here to help sift through the information to help identify sources and information that matters. 

Wilson, 1981

The result of a more truly user-oriented, innovative, experimental information profession should be a reduction in the marginality of information service. Scientific research generally recognizes the significance of services which provide access to the external research literature, but when such services are adopted by different kinds of organization with little or no adaptation in the light of a proper analysis of the needs of users or of their relationship with organizational communication systems, information services become increasingly marginal to the organization's functioning. Evidence for this can be found in industry, where, when economic pressures have been intense, numerous special libraries and information systems have been abolished or subject to severe staff redundancies.
