# Competency J

The tenth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to ["describe the fundamental concepts of information-seeking behaviors"](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/current-students/courses/core-competencies). Information seeking and information behavior are terms referring to human behavior that is so fundamental and commonplace that it can easily go unnoticed. These terms refer to the "common human cycle of needing, looking for, choosing, and using information of some kind" (Case, 2008, p. 35). Assessing an individual's information need and helping individuals meet those needs is part of the role of a librarian or information scientist. 

Information seeking behaviors begin with the information user or patron and their information need (Wilson, 1981). The patron recognizes that their knowledge and understanding about a subject is inadequate to achieve some result or goal. They tend to seek out informal reference sources more often than formal sources and will be satisfied with the first appropriate solution to their query rather than trying to find the best answer. Quality is often sacrificed for expediency and convenience (Rubin, 2016, p. 378; Case, 2008, p. 37-38). The information needs of individuals vary across these strata and occur within specific contexts both internal (e.g. memories, thoughts, motivations, and personality) and external (e.g. profession, family, and friends). The information seeking process is organic and can change between information queries as well as during the information seeking process. It "is rarely a simple, linear process that comes to complete fruition" (Case, 2008, p. 40). 

Information seeking behaviors are studied from a variety of perspectives including employment, role within society, and demographics (Rubin, 2016, p. 373). Many researchers have identified various ways to model information seeking. One study represented the information seeking process as six stages: initiation, selection, exploration, formulation, collection, and presentation (Kuhlthau, 1991, p. 367). Other models attempt to describe the relationship between communication, information seeking, information behavior, and information searching (Wilson, 1999). The rise of computer and internet technologies have made a major impact on individuals' information seeking behaviors. The World Wide Web (WWW) provides access to massive amounts of information and creates new ways of information searching and seeking. The WWW's chaotic and changing nature add complexity to the information seeking process. Seeking and searching for information on the WWW is a fluid, dynamic process where individuals use multiple search techniques within various contexts to find answers to their information queries.

## Conclusion

- Deluge of information in today's interconnected society. 
- Librarians and information scientists here to help sift through the information to help identify sources and information that matters. 

Wilson, 1981

The result of a more truly user-oriented, innovative, experimental information profession should be a reduction in the marginality of information service. Scientific research generally recognizes the significance of services which provide access to the external research literature, but when such services are adopted by different kinds of organization with little or no adaptation in the light of a proper analysis of the needs of users or of their relationship with organizational communication systems, information services become increasingly marginal to the organization's functioning. Evidence for this can be found in industry, where, when economic pressures have been intense, numerous special libraries and information systems have been abolished or subject to severe staff redundancies.
