The tenth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to ["describe the fundamental concepts of information-seeking behaviors"](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/current-students/courses/core-competencies).

Information seeking behaviors begin with the information user or patron and their information need (Wilson, 1981).

## Conclusion


Wilson, 1981

The result of a more truly user-oriented, innovative, experimental information profession should be a reduction in the marginality of information service. Scientific research generally recognizes the significance of services which provide access to the external research literature, but when such services are adopted by different kinds of organization with little or no adaptation in the light of a proper analysis of the needs of users or of their relationship with organizational comÂ­munication systems, information services become increasingly marginal to the organization's functioning. Evidence for this can be found in industry, where, when economic pressures have been intense, numerous special libraries and information systems have been abolished or subject to severe staff redundancies.
