# Competency G

The seventh competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to ["demonstrate understanding of basic principles and standards involved in organizing information such as classification and controlled vocabulary systems, cataloging systems, metadata schemas or other systems for making information accessible to a particular clientele;](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/current-students/courses/core-competencies).

The organization and analysis of information is of great significance to society and today's information age. The information, knowledge, and wisdom that is generated within societies is of little value if not for the ability to analyze, classify, and catalog this information. Classification and controlled vocabulary systems, cataloging systems, and metadata schemas are human-created tools used to help analyze the content or subject within information items. In addition to identifying the core essence of an information item, these tools reveal a network of related terms, concepts, and ideas found within and between information items. Identifying what an information item is about and its relationships to other related items lead to more easily and effectively retrieving an item in time of need. 

Human language is variable, rich, and complex. This richness and complexity brings ambiguity and nuance that can lead to confusion and misunderstanding. Controlled vocabularies refers to a pre-defined set of terms that represent an information item's subject and content. This includes subject headings, classification systems, thesauri, or approved keywords (Lancaster, 1986, 3). Controlled vocabularies and classification systems are designed to remove this complexity by combining similar or related terms and contrasting between homographs (Lancaster, 1986, 7). They organize and structure information items for later retrieval. The lack of controlled vocabularies in classification activities and systems leads to "wasted effort and a certain degree of searching failure" (Cleveland & Cleveland, 1990, 77). The presence of these systems ensures that indexers and searchers of information items use a common set of keywords and terms to consistently and predictably categorize, search, and find information items.
