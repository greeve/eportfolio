# Competency F


The sixth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to ["use the basic concepts and principles related to the selection, evaluation, organization, and preservation of physical and digital information items;"](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/current-students/courses/core-competencies).

Information organizations select, evaluate, organize, and preserve physical and digital information items for a variety of reasons depending on the mission and aims of the organization. 

The basic concepts and principles related to the selection, evaluation, organization, and preservation of an item are applied in different ways by an information organization depending on the organization's mission and aims. 

For example, an archive or special collection will emphasize the preservation of the item over the patron's ability to easy find and borrow the item. 

Selection and evaluation requires knowing as much about the item itself as possible including the item's historical context and value as well as the condition of the item
