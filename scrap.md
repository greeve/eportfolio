Information retrieval systems are an essential part of many organizational settings where information professionals practice. Their form and use evolve as technology continues to advance and improve. A reflective essay assignment in LIBR 200 about information retrieval systems sheds light on a core part of the practice of information professionals. 

## LIBR 200 Reflective Essay: Information Retrieval Systems

Technology is another important part of the organizational setting for information professionals. 

A reflective essay assignment in LIBR 200 explores the importance of information retrieval systems within the field of library and information science.

Information is the lifeblood of an information professional. 

The value of information is directly related to the ability to effectively store and retrive that information as needed. 

An information retrieval system can be defined as “a device interposed between a potential end-user 
of an information collection and the information collection itself” (Harter, 1986, p.2)

Geographic Information systems (GIS) can be broadly defined as any integrated collection of computer software and data used to capture, store, modify, analyze, and retrieve geospatial information. Data in a GIS is georeferenced data representing features or locations on earth that also contains non-spatial tabular data containing attributes about the feature. The development of GIS grew out of spatial analysis within the disciple of geography starting in the late 1960s. Canada’s Department of Forestry and Rural Development developed "a computer-based information system for the storage and manipulation of map-based land data" (Tomlinson, 1968). This first GIS system allowed cartographic themes to be mapped digitally and overlaid with other different thematic layers (Tomlinson, 1968, p. 202). GIS is multi-disciplinary in its development and practical use today combining areas of cartography and mapping with geography, statistical analysis, computer science. The application of GIS can be found across many fields of study including the humanities and the physical, life, social, and applied sciences.

GIS is a powerful tool that librarians or information scientists can use to
