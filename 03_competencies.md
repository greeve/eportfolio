A Statement of Competency is required for each of the 14 Core Competencies (A - N or A-O depending on when you entered the school). While each advisor may have different specifics they would prefer that you address, in general, consider the following as an example of a competency statement organization:

- Start with what you understand the competency to mean - define the competency. Be careful to thoroughly address each part of the competency. Explain why it is important to the profession as a whole. Use the rubrics -these are your guidelines to writing a successful statement of competency.
- Discuss what coursework/work experience prepared you for understanding and being able to perform the competency.
- Now present and discuss each piece of evidence you selected - say why you selected this evidence and how it demonstrates your competency and the skills and knowledge you learned.
- Close by discussing how you are able (know how to, or can) apply or transfer your skills and knowledge in the future to different [work] situations or environments.
- You must include a minimum of one piece of evidence for each competency; however, submitting two or three pieces of evidence is preferred. The final decision rests with your e-Portfolio advisor whether more will be required. See Examples of Evidentiary Items for more specifics about evidence. Note: Your evidence should be in its own section either as attachments or URLS.
