The fifth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to ["design, query, and evaluate information retrieval systems"](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/current-students/courses/core-competencies).

Information retrieval (IR) is the process of finding information resources that answer a particular information need by searching a collection of stored data. 

An information retriveval system (IR system) is a system designed to help search and find specific information from one or more stored data repositories. 

Harter (1986) defined an IR system as "a device interposed between a potential end-user of an information collection and the information collection itself" (p. 2).

IR systems are composed of two basic components: 1) the database that stores the data and 2) a mechanism for retrieving information out of the database. 

The term database refers to the structured set of data stored in a way that facilitates information retrieval. 

IR systems can be analog or digital in nature. 

The library can be considered a type of IR system (Rubin, 2010, p. 127). 

Printed indexes and bibliographies are other examples of analog IR systems.

Since the late 20th century computer and networking technologies have replaced many analog IR systems with digital or electronic systems. 

Bibliographic records have been converted into digital formats including the MARC (machine readable cataloging)  and BIBFRAME (Bibliographic Framework) record formats. 

These digital record formats enable computers to store, connect, parse, and retrieve bibliographic information in more automated, efficient ways than possible using analog formats.

The online public access catalog (OPAC) is an electronic IR system that can store and retrieve bibliographic information for use by an information organization. 

While originally designed as an electronic replacement of the analog library card catalog system OPACs have developed into sophistocated IR systems with improved search and discovery technologies that information organizations rely on for access to physical and electronic resources.

Web search engines are another type of electronic IR system. 

The development and now ubiquity of the World Wide Web has afforded the creation of web search engines to help end-users search for information available on the World Wide Web.

Coursework and projects in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program provided opportunities to design, query, and evaluate IR systems.
