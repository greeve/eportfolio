The fifth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to ["design, query, and evaluate information retrieval systems"](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/current-students/courses/core-competencies).

Information retrieval (IR) is the process of finding information resources that answer a particular information need by searching a collection of stored data. 

An information retriveval system (IR system) is a system designed to help search and find specific information from one or more stored data repositories. 

Harter (1986) defined an IR system as "a device interposed between a potential end-user of an information collection and the information collection itself" (p. 2).

IR systems are composed of two basic components: 1) the database that stores the data and 2) a mechanism for retrieving information out of the database. 

The term database refers to the structured set of data stored in a way that facilitates information retrieval. 

IR systems can be analog or digital in nature. 

The library can be considered a type of IR system (Rubin, 2010, p. 127). 

Printed indexes and bibliographies are other examples of analog IR systems.

Since the late 20th century computer and networking technologies have replaced many analog IR systems with digital or electronic systems. 

Bibliographic records have been converted into digital formats including the MARC (machine readable cataloging)  and BIBFRAME (Bibliographic Framework) record formats. 

These digital record formats enable computers to store, connect, parse, and retrieve bibliographic information in more automated, efficient ways than possible using analog formats.

The online public access catalog (OPAC) is an electronic IR system that can store and retrieve bibliographic information for use by an information organization. 

While originally designed as an electronic replacement of the analog library card catalog system OPACs have developed into sophistocated IR systems with improved search and discovery technologies that information organizations rely on for access to physical and electronic resources.

Web search engines are another type of electronic IR system. 

The development and now ubiquity of the World Wide Web has afforded the creation of web search engines to help end-users search for information available on the World Wide Web.

Coursework and projects in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program provided opportunities to design, query, and evaluate IR systems. 

The design, querying, and evaluation of an IR system are based upon the system's ability to match information from the IR system with the end-user's information need.

Designing an IR system begins with identifying the intended end-users of the system.

Knowing who will use the system leads to identifying their information needs and shapes what and how data is entered into the IR system.

The design of an IR system also includes identifying and developing controlled vocabularies, keywords, and indexes of the data in the system to facilitate efficient information retrieval. 

Querying refers to an end-user's interaction with an IR system by entering search queries and terms relevant to their information need.

The aim of an IR system is to return (or retrieve) information from the system that is most relevant to the end-user's information needs.

Evaluating an IR system assesses the effectiveness of the system to meet the information needs of end-users. 

An effective IR system distinguishes between relevant and nonrelevant documents in the IR system's collection of data.

Precision and recall are two basic measures for information retrieval effectiveness (Kerry, Kent, and Berry, 1955). 

Precision is the ratio of relevant items retrieved to all retrieved items. 

It is the number of correct results that match the search query divded by the number of all items returned by the search. 

Recall is the ratio of relevant items retrieved to all relevant items in the IR system's collection.

It is the number of correct results divided by the number of items that should have been returned by the search query.

An IR system with high precision returns more relevant items than nonrelevant items.

An IR system with high recall means that the system returns a majority of the relevant items.

An IR system should optimize for precision or recall based on the information needs of the system's end-users. 

Some end users may want the IR system to have high recall and will tolerate low precision to ensure they get everything that could be relevant. 

Other end users may want to see the IR system return the most relevant items first (high precision) while not caring about the entire set of items retrieved (low recall).
