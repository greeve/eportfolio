# Compentency B

The second core competency is to "describe and compare organizational settings in which information professionals practice" (!ref). 

As the amount and significance of information in society continues to increase there is a correlated increase in the need for information profressionals. 

Information professionals work in a variety of organizational environments that span many disciplines. 

These professional information disciplines can be viewed as additional disciplines at the same level and along the same scpectrum as other professional disciplines.

The information disciplines can alternatively be seen as "meta-disciplines" that span all other disciplines (Bates, 2015).

Another way to categorize the organizational settings of information professionals is to categorize these organizationas by their fundamental role in socity. 

Some organizations are designed to generate profit while others are created for non-profit aims and purposes.

Organizations are found in governments and public-sector organizations as well as private-sector companies.

The nature of the organization influences the missions, aims, and goals of the organization's members and employees. 

This also influences the type of work performed by information professionals. 

A reflective essay assignment in LIBR 200 explores a professional association within the information profession. 

Professional associations are typical of non-profit organizations that support the advancement of professionals within a given field of labor. 

Example professional associations include the American Library Association (ALA), the American Society for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&T), 
International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), and the Special Libraries Association (SLA).

 Researching and writing about the Association of Research Libraries helps further understand one type of organizational setting available to information professionals.

Strategic planning is an essential tool to guide and shape the environment and direction of an organization. 

The practice of information professionals within organizations is directly affected by the organization's mission, aims, values, and goals. 

A semester-long project to develop a strategic plan for an existing public library was valuable to better understand the organizational setting where public library staff practice their craft.

## LIBR 200 Reflective Essay: Professional Associations

This assignment required writing about a professional association within the library and information and profession.

Professional associations are important to the organizational setting of information professionals because of their role in providing a support network that connects together similar organizations.

This support network gives practitioners access to resources and tools that can help them accomplish their work that would be hard to find and discover on their own.  

This reflective essay focuses on the Association of Research Libraries (ARL; !link, ref?). 

Started in 1932 by 42 university and research library directors the ARL is a non-profit library association that currently includes 125 research libraries. 

The association's core principles and mission center are built upon open access to information, research libraries as a major source of knowledge to society, identifying and acting on emerging trends, and meeting the needs of the communities served by each research library. 

Like many professional associations, ARL acts like connective tissue linking library and information organizations with similar goals and initiatives. 

The work done by the ARL and its member research libraries establish industry standards, policies, and best practices for information professionals that help them better serve their patron's and communities.

## LIBR 204 Strategic Planning Project

An information professional's organizational setting is shaped and influenced by many forces both intentional and unintentional.

Strategic planning is the organizational process that strives to shape and direct the mission, vision, and values of an organization and its members. 

It also includes environmental scanning and analyzing the organization's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT).

This planning process and the implementation of that plan also shape the organizational setting of information professionals. 

A two-phase, semester-long group project in LIBR 204 included formulating a strategic plan for the Hingham Public Library in Hingham, Massachusetts.

This project explored the framework that assists in defining the organizational setting for public library staff and librarians. 

Phase one in the project included a literature review about evironmental scanning, creating the public library's mission, vision, and values statement, an environmental scan of the library, and SWOT analysis.

Elements of phase one were used to formulate and present a strategic plan for the library.

This project revealed the organizational setting of a public library and the importance of carefully choosing and following its mission, vision, and values. 

It also demonstrated the need for library staff to accurately identify the organization's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

"Organizations must be 
designed to be flexible so they can adapt to change" and increase involvement and 
communication between management and various departments within the organization (Huffman, 2004, p. 48). 

This project demonstrated that the work performed in this public library is a valuable and relevant part of the library's local community. 

The work and responsibilites of library staff directly contribute to achieving the library's mission, vision, and values. 

## Conclusion

Information professionals practice in a variety of organizational settings. 

Some work directly with emerging technolgies and trends. 

Information organizations in today's society require employees to keep pace with the evolving work skills and requirements. 

Progessional associations connect information professionals to a network of other professionals in the same domain of work. 

Through these associations information professionals receive skills, best practices, and resources to accomplish their work responsibilities and meet the needs of their communities. 

Strategic planning is another part of an organization's setting that influences the work and focus of information professionals within the organization. 

An organization's mission, vision, and values create a framework that information professionals work within and use to help meet the needs of those they serve.
