# Competency N

The fourteenth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to ["evaluate programs and services using measurable criteria"](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/current-students/courses/core-competencies).

Evaluation can be defined as a process for making judgements about the qualities of something. The purpose behind evaluation is to provide feedback to influence making decisions or policies. Without evaluation an individual, group, or organization is blind to their progress towards an aim or goal. Evaluation is used by information organizations to "[determine] the success, impact, results, costs, outcomes, or other factors related to a library activity, program, service, or resource use" (McClure, 2008, p. 179). An information organization uses evaluation as a means to determine how well they meet the needs of their patrons or clientele and how wisely they are using their allocated resources. Evaluation helps focus the organization on the priorties and efforts that give the greatest impact and benefit to their communities. This process of evaluation helps information organizations ensure that the day-to-day work and efforts are aligned with the organization's mission, vision, and strategic goals. 

As the purpose and focus of information organizations shifts they have an important need to show their continued value in a changning society. To show their value they will need to ask the right questions to find answers that demonstrate their importance and value within society. Traditionally information organizations have focused on building their collections and so the value and quality of the organization was tied to the size of their collections (Hernon and Altman, 2010, p. 2). Assessing and evaluating the value of an information organization requires asking questions better focused on their modern-day purpose and function. 

Asking the right questions and then gathering the right data to accurately measure how things really are within an organization is a challenging aspect of evaluation and assessment. Information organizations (or more specifically libraries) do well at collecting usage statistics. The idea has been that if "libraries are used, they are of value to the users" (Tenopir, 2012, p. 6). These kinds of measures are focused on measuring the inputs and outputs to libraries but miss the processes and outcomes that come from a library. This includes understanding the needs of library patrons and their satisfaction with library services. 

The evaluation process utilizes measures and quality standards. Measures identify the observed state or value of a particular program or service at a particular moment in time. The evaluation process can utilize many different types of measures including performance measures (i.e. how well something is performed), output measures (i.e. the result of a program or service), and outcome measures (i.e. the impact of a program or service on something else). Quality standards are the desired quality or performance level of an organization's program or service. As the right questions are asked and measured information organizations will position themselves to be able to demonstrate their value to their patrons and communities. Coursework in the SJSU MLIS program provided training and experience to evaluate programs and services using measurable criteria.

## Conclusion

The world and its societies are in states of continual churn and change. 

Evaluation helps organizations and their staff adapt to their changing environment.

Developing an evaluation culture

Evaluation is best performed regularly on an ongoing, interative basis. 

At their core information organizations are the people that work within them. 

People are imperfect beings that make mistakes and can lead an organization down wrong paths and activities. 

Evaluation should be considered as an evolutionary, ongoing process to correct for these mistakes and imperfections that shape an organization and its staff towards service excellence. 

As an information organization focuses on measuring (and improving) service quality it will meet the needs of its patrons or clientele. In turn this will create value for patrons and the organization's surrounding community.
