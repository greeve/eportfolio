# Competency I

The ninth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to ["use service concepts, principles, and techniques to connect individuals or groups with accurate, relevant, and appropriate information"](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/current-students/courses/core-competencies).

Information organizations haven't always been service oriented (Tyckoson, 2008, p. 128). Historically information organizations have focused on building collections and preserving materials in those collections. Patrons of those organizations were predominately a relatively small class of elites within society. The majority of people within society were denied access to these information organizations and their collections due to a variety of factors including economic status and low literacy rates. There was an overall low general demand for personal access to reading materials. Since the late 19th century information organizations and their staff have shifted towards a more service-oriented approach as literacy and education rates increased helping to raise demand for access to reading materials. 

The first meeting of the American Library Association addressed the need for information organizations to provide better reference services for patrons. It was stated in the conference that "[p]ersonal intercourse and relations between librarian and readers are useful in all libraries" (Green, 1876, p. 79). Librarians should attend to the needs of patrons like shop-keepers, inn-keepers, and store clerks strive to serve their customers (Green, 1876, p. 79-80). This establishes the core model for information organizations and their staff to connect individuals and groups with accurate, relevant, and appropriate information: 1) Patrons come to the organization seeking answers to their inquiries and 2) the organization staff interact with the patrons to help them find answers to their questions. Effectively connecting individuals and groups with information requires seeing the patron and their information requests as opportunities for service rather than an "irritation at being interrupted" (Finks, 1991, p. 353). Thus, the value of an information organization, librarian, or information scientist lies in their ability to help clientele and patrons search, find, and discover information they need. 

Librarians or information scientists answer questions and information requests for a wide variety of items and topics that they may know little about. The skills of the librarian or information scientist lie in their ability to process information requests regardless of their personal knowledge of the matter. They rely upon their knowledge of domain classifications, reference resources, search and information retrieval to know where the answer can be found to help meet the information needs of the patron (Green, 1876, p. 77). They are aware of ethical considerations and policies that govern how they interact with patrons and clientele in an honest and open way that respects the rights and privacy of the patron as well as the information organization and its materials. They promote and support freedom of information and the free access of information to improve and better oneself. They are flexible, amenable, and creative thinkers who react quickly and nimbly in their interactions with the organization's clientele or staff. They are life-long learners that continually seek to progress in their understanding and knowledge of principles, subject areas, concepts, and tools that enable them to effectively answer the information requests of clientele or patrons.

## Conclusion

Rangnathan's (1964) seminole treatise on library science lists five laws that information organizations should follow that support all reference service efforts: 1) information items are for use, 2) find everyone their information item, 3) reach out and promote information items to find their owner or patron, 4) save time for the patron, and 5) an information organization is a living organism with chances for growth and decay. These five laws along with principles enumerated in Green's (1876) ALA conference address clarify the core principles and concepts of reference services. The information organization is an "instrument of universal education". Reference services are the spirit of the information organization (Rangnathan, 1964, 354).
