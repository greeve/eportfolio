# Competency I

The ninth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to ["use service concepts, principles, and techniques to connect individuals or groups with accurate, relevant, and appropriate information"](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/current-students/courses/core-competencies).

Information organizations haven't always been service oriented (Tyckoson, 2008, p. 128). 

Historically information organizations have focused on building collections and preserving materials in those collections. 

Patrons of those organizations were predominately a relatively small class of elites within society. 

The majority of people within society were denied access to these information organiations and their collections due to a variety of factors including economic status and low literacy rates.

There was an overall low general demand for personal access to reading materials. 

Since the late 19th century information organizations and their staff have shifted towards a more service-oriented approach as literacy and education rates increased helping to raise demand for access to reading materials. 

The first meeting of the American Library Association addressed the need for information organizations to provide better reference services for patrons. 

It was stated in the conference that "[p]ersonal intercourse and relations between librarian and readers are useful in all libraries" (Green, 1876, p. 79).

Librarians should attend to the needs of patrons like shop-keepers, inn-keepers, and store clerks strive to serve their customers (Green, 1876, p. 79-80). 

This defined the core model for librarians and information scientists to connect individuals and groups with accurate, relevant, and appropriate information: 1) Patrons come to the organization seeking answers to their inquries and 2) the organization staff interact with the patrons to help them find answers to their questions. 

The value of the work of a librarian or information scientist lies in their ability to help clientele and patrons search, find, and discover information they need.
