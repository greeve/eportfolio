# Competency L

The twelfth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to ["demonstrate understanding of quantitative and qualitative research methods, the ability to design a research project, and the ability to evaluate and synthesize research literature"](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/current-students/courses/core-competencies).

Research is a rigorous, systematic process that examines and studies information to expand or apply human knowledge. Research has been classified into two main methods: basic and applied (National Science Foundation, 1953, p. 38). Basic research is "concerned with creating new, generalizable knowledge" while applied research is "concerned with the solving of specific problems in real situations" (Powell, 2008, p. 169). One type is focused on creating new theories and knowledge that can be broadly applied. The other is focused on discovering applications of the general theories and knowledge. Basic and applied research can be better understood by comparing research to trees: basic research is the broad trunk of the tree while applied research is the leaves at the tips of the branches (Brady, 2015). This implies that these two methods are seen as a continuum or spectrum. Research can fall somewhere between the two types of research rather than a binary categorization. Both types of research can feed into the other. Basic and applied research can also be either quantitative or qualitative in nature or some combination of the two. A quantitative approach means that the research is measurable using numerical means. A qualitative approach means that the research is focused on characteristics, qualities, events, and behaviors of the subject (or subjects) involved in the research.

While ideas for research questions and projects can come from various sources a common source comes from critical evaluation and synthesis of existing research literature. Using the results of research projects is limited if a librarian or information scientist lacks the ability to critically evaluate each research project (Powell, 2008, p. 177). Once a research topic and approaches are chosen the next step is in designing a project that will help answer the original research questions. This will include determining the best method for capturing data that will help answer the research question. Research methods and techniques used to gather data include surveys, experiments, history and historical primary sources, case studies, focus groups, content analyses, bibliometrics, ethnography, grounded theory, phenomenology, hermeneutics, reflexivity, and discourse analysis. After data is collected that helps answer the original research question the data is analyzed. Data analysis includes organizing, summarizing, and generalizing the collected data to help identify patterns and draw conclusions. After the data is analyzed and summarized the researcher reports the research project's findings in some form of a report that can be communicated to individuals or groups with an interest in the results.
