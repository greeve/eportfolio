# Competency L

The twelfth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to ["demonstrate understanding of quantitative and qualitative research methods, the ability to design a research project, and the ability to evaluate and synthesize research literature"](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/current-students/courses/core-competencies).

Research is a rigorous, systematic process that examines and studies information to expand or apply human knowledge. Research has been classified into two main methods: basic and applied (National Science Foundation, 1953, p. 38). Basic research is "concerned with creating new, generalizable knowledge" while applied research is "concerned with the solving of specific problems in real situations" (Powell, 2008, p. 169). One type is focused on creating new theories and knowledge that can be broadly applied. The other is focused on discovering applications of the general theories and knowledge. Basic and applied research can be better understood by comparing research to trees: basic research is the broad trunk of the tree while applied research is the leaves at the tips of the branches (Brady, 2015). This implies that these two methods are seen as a continuum or spectrum. Research can fall somewhere between the two types of research rather than a binary categorization. Both types of research can feed into the other. Basic and applied research can also be either quantitative or qualitative in nature or some combination of the two. A quantitative approach means that the research is measurable using numerical means. A qualitative approach means that the research is focused on characteristics, qualities, events, and behaviors of the subject (or subjects) involved in the research.

While ideas for research questions and projects can come from various sources a common source comes from critical evaluation and synthesis of existing research literature. Using the results of research projects is limited if a librarian or information scientist lacks the ability to critically evaluate existing research projects (Powell, 2008, p. 177). Once a research topic and methodology are chosen the next step is designing a project that will help answer the original research questions. This will include determining the best method for capturing data that will help answer the research question. Research methods and techniques used to gather data include surveys, experiments, history and historical primary sources, case studies, focus groups, content analyses, bibliometrics, ethnography, grounded theory, phenomenology, hermeneutics, reflexivity, and discourse analysis. After data is collected that helps answer the original research question the data is analyzed. Data analysis includes organizing, summarizing, and generalizing the collected data to help identify patterns and draw conclusions. After the data is analyzed and summarized the researcher reports the research project's findings in some form of a report that can be communicated to individuals or groups with an interest in the results. Coursework completed in the SJSU MLIS program provided experience with these research concepts and processes. 

## Evidence

The following coursework demonstrates an understanding of quantiative and qualitative research methods, the ability to design a research project, and the ability to evaluate and synthesize research literature.

2. INFO 285 Research methods critique
3. INFO 285 Research Project Proposal

### [INFO 285 Literature Review]() 

A literature review is the product of evaluating and synthesizing published information about a given subject area. By definition it is a secondary source. It doesn't add any new ideas but summarizes and synthesizes existing research and literature on a given subject. The organization and presentation of the literature review can vary but is centered around a particular research topic. The selected topic is used to search for sources related to the research topic. The literature review can be organized chronologically, methodologically, or thematically. The choice of organizational method depends upon the type and purpose of the literature review. A well constructed literature review explains why the review is being conducted. The body of the review can identify general trends, conflicts, gaps of research, or new perspectives in the related field.  

To prepare for writing a research project proposal a library research methods course (INFO 285) required writing a literature review. Successfully writing this literature review required clearly defining the research question. The research question for this literature review is to evaluate and assess whether the electronic finding aid interface for the L. Tom Perry Special Collections in the Harold B. Lee Library (HBLL) at Brigham Young University (BYU) is meeting the needs of its patrons. The literature review explored this study question by looking at literature related to the display of electronic archival finding aids. Basic characteristics of all the sources was enumerated including how many years the research spanned, the methodologies taken by the research, and the statistical approaches of any research projects in the literature. After this introduction to the literature major themes are discussed that were discovered while evaluating each source. These themes included user groups, display elements, navigation and search, and content standards. After discussing these themes the conclusion highlights disagreement and gaps in the literature that present opportunities for further research and study. This assignment is evidence of learning how to evaluate and synthesize research literature. 

### [INFO 285: Research Methods Critique]()

Not all research studies are of equal value. The ability to critically evaluate a research study is a key part of understanding and applying principles and practices that will positively contribute to a given research domain (Boswell and Cannon, 2009, p. 292). As part of a larger effort in a library research methods course (INFO 285) a critique of an existing research study was written that related to a research project proposal. The research topic was about assessing the interface and display of electronic archival finding aids. The critique focused on the published results of a usability study aimed to assess the display of electronic archival finding aids at the Southern Historical Collection (Chapman, 2010). The rubric for critically assessing this study comes from criteria identified by Boswell and Cannon (2009). The critique examined the research study's report form, purpose, literature review, research questions, methodology, and results. The critique of the published research study reveals Chapman's assumptions, definitions, strengths, and limitations. 

Comparing the research study with the criteria enumerated by Boswell and Cannon (2009) reveals that the report writing lacks consistency and clarity. The purpose for the research is clearly defined as the researcher hopes that their study, combined with past studies, will increase the overall knowledge and understanding of library and information scientists related to electronic archival finding aid displays. Despite being exhaustive in quantity and quality of reviewed research, the literature review lacks direction and focus toward the research study's purpose. Research questions the researcher poses aren't clearly linked to the rest of the report making it unsure where the questions came from that are driving the research project. The origins and reasons for the research study's design and methodology are not clearly explained. The study's reports and recommendations fall short in that they are presented as though the results from this study can apply to other archives and special collections organizations but the statistical methods used in the study lack the robustness required to be able to make generalizations about the results. 

Using a standard rubric for evaluating and critiquing research studies helps to objectively identify a study's strengths and weaknesses. Evaluating the research report's use of statistical methods and analyses in particular helps to identify pitfalls to avoid in using statistical methods in a research study. This research methods critique demonstrates the ability to understand qualitative and quantitative research methods as well as evaluate research literature. 

### [INFO 285 Research Project Proposal]()

Research proposals are intended to persuade other scholars that are part of another committee or organization that the proposed research study contains the qualities of "conceptual innovation, methodological rigor, and rich, substantive content" (Przeworski and Salomon, 1995, p. 1). The proposal should answer 1) what will be learned from the research study, 2) why does the study matter, and 3) how can one know to trust the results (Przeworski and Salomon, 1995, p. 2). A class teaching research methods (INFO 285) that focused on library evaluation and assessment required creating a research project proposal that would evaluate and assess some program or aspect of a library. This research project proposal focused on evaluating and assessing the electronic archival finding aid interface and display for the L. Tom Perry Special Collections in the Harold B. Lee Library (HBLL) at Brigham Young University (BYU). The library's finding aid interface was redesigned almost eight years previously. This project proposal would request support to evaluate and assess whether the current finding aid display meets the needs of patrons to the library. 

This final project was a semester-long effort tying together concepts related to library evaluation and assessment, research methods, and statistical analyses.
