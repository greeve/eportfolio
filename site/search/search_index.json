            "text": "After Steve Jobs introduced the iPad at the January 27, 2010 Apple Keynote (Apple, 2010) he commented on why Apple is able to make the kind of products they make:\n\n\n\n\nNow the reason that Apple is able to create products like the iPad is because we\u2019ve always tried to be at the intersection of technology and liberal arts. To be able to get the best of both. To make extremely advanced products from a technology point of view but also have them be intuitive, easy to use, fun to use so that they really fit the users; the users don\u2019t have to come to them; they come to the user. And its the combination of these two things that I think has let us make the kind of creative products like the iPad.\n\n\n\n\nStanding at the intersection of technology and liberal arts is an idea that keenly resonates with me. As I reflect on my experience with libraries and in the \nSan Jose State University (SJSU) Masters of Library and Information Science (MLIS) program\n I see a parallel between Jobs' statement about creating the iPad and the value of the library. \n\n\nLibraries also stand at the intersection of technology and liberal arts. Libraries strive to bring out the best in both technology and the liberal arts. Libraries and information organizations provide services and products that span multiple disciplines and strive to be intuitive, easy to use, and fun to use. They continue to improve in becoming user-centric and working to meet the needs of their patrons and clientele. It was this idea that brought me to pursue a MLIS from SJSU and continues to drive my passion today. \n\n\nAfter graduating with \nBS in Geography\n from \nBrigham Young University (BYU)\n in 2007 I worked professionally in the field of computerized mapping and Geographic Information Systems. During this time I developed an interest to pursue a masters degree in library and information science. I wanted to shift my professional career towards working in an academic library utilizing computer and technology skills gained from my school, professional, and personal experience. I started the \nSJSU MLIS program\n in the Fall semester of 2013. With every course my love for libraries and desire to shift careers increased.\n\n\nThis portfolio is the culminating result of this degree. The portfolio is divided up into the following sections:\n\n\n\n\nStatement of Professional Philosophy\n: A statement that expresses my personal philosophy of librarianship and how libraries contribute to the cultural, economic, educational and social well-being of our communities. \n\n\nCompetencies\n: Statements of competency for the \nSJSU MLIS 14 core competencies\n.\n\n\nConclusion\n: Concluding statements including reflections on the MLIS program. \n\n\nAffirmation\n: A statement affirmation this work is mine and mine alone and that the portfolio is password-protected and privacy of others is respected.\n\n\n\n\nEach statement of competency includes evidence gathered from the assignments and projects completed during the MLIS program. These pieces of evidence were collected and saved after each semester for the purpose of utilizing them in this portfolio. Evidence includes links to PDF files of submitted work or links to external content including screencasts and external sites hosting previously submitted assignments. You are invited to view my portfolio for INFO 289 to complete my MLIS at SJSU.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nApple. (2010, January 27). Apple announces ipad. [Episode 26]. \nApple Keynotes\n.

            "text": "We live in an age of rapid technological advancement. What was once considered science fiction is now reality. We now carry in our pockets mini-computers capable of communicating wirelessly across large geographies! Despite these significant advancements there continues to be severe economic disparity in accessing these new technologies and learning the skills needed to take advantage of these technologies. This economic inequality is referred to as the \u201cdigital divide.\u201d Libraries are working hard to close this divide so more people have the access and the skills necessary to be part of our changing, digital world. Rubin (2010) provides an area of focus where libraries can help close the digital divide stating, \u201cAs more and more information becomes available online, there is a tremendous need to teach effective search techniques and evaluation skills\u201d (p. 178). Like the digital divide there are many other \"divides\" within a community including cultural, educational, and social divides. These gaps in understanding push individuals and communities apart and can lead to miscommunication and mistrust. The library stands at the intersection of communities, technologies, and the liberal arts. They are positioned in society to be a force for good in closing these gaps that exist. By reflecting on my personal experiences with libraries, one can see the impact libraries have in contributing to the cultural, economic, educational, and social well-being of a community in helping to bridge these divides.\n\n\nI remember going often to my elementary school library. In that library and as a young student I first learned about computers and the information superhighway. There I received hands-on instruction using computers for word processing, printing documents, using computer programs like Oregon Trail and Word Munchers, keyboard typing, and HyperCard. My elementary school library taught me basic computer skills and curiosity with digital technologies that has informed my interests and pursuits to the present day. In my school library I watched documentaries and read books about social, economic, and political issues that introduced me to new ideas and cultures. \n\n\nMy family didn't have Internet access in our home until late into my high school years. The High School library computers were the first computers I used to understand and explore the World Wide Web. I relied on the school library computers to access information online for school assignments and research papers. School libraries provided a way for me to develop skills in searching and retrieving information from the Internet that weren't possible previously. The high-school library also provided a place of interaction and connection with friends before and after school. We used the library to socialize, share ideas, and work on homework together. \n\n\nPublic libraries were also important to me in my youth. Individually and with my family I would regularly go to local public libraries to check out books, magazines, music CDs, and movies. At the public library I would use the Internet for checking email and browsing the web. Access to the public library computers helped me apply for summer jobs while in between school years. Public libraries closed the digital divide for me by giving me access to the Internet and allowing me to connect to the digital world. Before a personal identification card, drivers license, or credit card I owned my own library card. Having a library card that I was responsible for strengthened my confidence and independence. It was empowering to checkout out my own materials myself without reliance on my parents or siblings and to be part of the local library community. Visiting the library and seeing members of the community there engaging in various educational, business, or recreational pursuits was energizing and motivating. \n\n\nMy first introduction to academic libraries was in high school for an English class research paper. To gather research information for this assignment as well as introduce us to an academic library, our English class took a field trip to a local University library. I was amazed at the size and scale of the library as well as the large number of digital services available for college students. Working in the academic library instilled within me confidence and excitement to pursue additional education at the university level. Later, as a college student at \nBrigham Young University (BYU)\n, I relied heavily on the digital resources available in the university library for completing assignments and staying in touch with family over email. The college library computers provided me access to the Internet and other computing technologies when I couldn't afford to pay for them myself. It also provided me access to books that motivated my own personal learning and study outside of a classroom setting. The use of the academic library instilled in me the desire to always be a life-long learner. \n\n\nPursuing a masters degree in Library and Information Science has magnified my understanding of the role libraries play in society and the good they do to communities. Each course in the degree emphasized the power and potential of libraries to provide for the cultural, economic, educational, and social well-being of communities. The \ncore competencies of an SJSU MLIS\n and the \nevidence chosen to demonstrate those competencies\n stand as evidence to this truth of the library as beacon for good. My experience in the SJSU MLIS program echoes the excitement and trust expressed by Melvil Dewey (1876) in the initial issue of \nThe American Library Journal\n:\n\n\n\n\nThe founders [of this journal] have an intense faith in the future of our libraries, and believe that if the best methods can be applied by the best librarians, the public may soon be brought to recognize our claim that the free library ranks with the free school. We hold that there is no work reaching father in its influence and deserving more honor than the work with a competent and earnest librarian can do for his [or her] community (p. 6).\n\n\n\n\nMy experiences with school libraries, public libraries, academic libraries, and pursing a masters degree in Library and Information Science demonstrate that libraries are an amazing force for good that contribute to the cultural, economic, educational, and social well-being of communities. They provide opportunities to communities and patrons that wouldn't be possible otherwise. They can also play a positive role in giving access to new technology and teaching the skills to use these technologies so that communities and patrons are active participants in today's digital world. As libraries have proved valuable to me in bridging the cultural, economic, educational, and social divides, I feel libraries can also help bridge these gaps for others. As a recipient of that help to access and learn new technologies and new ideas, I look forward to the opportunities as an employee of an academic library to serve others in bridging these gaps for themselves. \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nDewey, M.

The \nCode of Ethics of the American Library Association\n is the codified set of principles and values that guide the work of various information professionals including those working in an academic library with emerging technologies and digital services. Originally adopted in 1939 and revised over the years these principles and values act as anchors in an information environment that is under continual change allowing information professionals the freedom to govern themselves when facing ethical dilemmas and situations. The following eight fundamental statements are found in the \nCode of Ethics\n (ALA, 2008):\n\n\n\n\nWe provide the highest level of service to all library users through appropriate and usefully organized resources; equitable service policies; equitable access; and accurate, unbiased, and courteous responses to all requests.\n\n\nWe uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and resist all efforts to censor library resources.\n\n\nWe protect each library user's right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to information sought or received and resources consulted, borrowed, acquired or transmitted.\n\n\nWe respect intellectual property rights and advocate balance between the interests of information users and rights holders.\n\n\nWe treat co-workers and other colleagues with respect, fairness, and good faith, and advocate conditions of employment that safeguard the rights and welfare of all employees of our institutions.\n\n\nWe do not advance private interests at the expense of library users, colleagues, or our employing institutions.\n\n\nWe distinguish between our personal convictions and professional duties and do not allow our personal beliefs to interfere with fair representation of the aims of our institutions or the provision of access to their information resources.\n\n\nWe strive for excellence in the profession by maintaining and enhancing our own knowledge and skills, by encouraging the professional development of co-workers, and by fostering the aspirations of potential members of the profession.\n\n\n\n\nOther professional information organizations use their own code of ethics including \nA Code of Ethics for Information Scientists\n and the \nWorldCat Rights and Responsibilities for the OCLC Cooperative\n. Public and academic libraries also create their own set of ethical policies and procedures.\u00a0These procedures clarify the role of the librarian and the librarian's relationship to patrons.\u00a0They also explain how patron circulation records are handled and kept confidential as well as the extent of legal counsel a librarian can provide. An example of the application of a information profession's ethics and values can be found in the guideline documents from the \nReference and User Services Association\n including the \nHealth and Medical Reference Guidelines\n and \nGuidelines for Behavioral Performance of Reference and Information Service Providers\n.\u00a0These guidelines find application in a variety of professional settings where information professionals interact with patrons and help them find the information they are seeking.\u00a0The performance of an information professional answering the information needs of a patron can be judged based on their professional behavior, understanding and following their organization's policies, and respecting the patron's rights to information. This understanding of the ethics involved with patron interaction is addressed in a reference interview assignment for LIBR 210.\u00a0Within the information professions ethical codes are rooted in the goal of establishing environments of \"intellectual freedom and the freedom of access to information\" (ALA, 2008).\u00a0In the course of following a professional code of ethics situations sometimes arise that create ethical dilemmas where there is an apparent conflict between two or more ethical principles.\u00a0An example dilemma involving intellectual freedom and access to information can occur when trying to meet the needs of individuals while also providing for the good of the community.\u00a0A discussion posting in LIBR 200 illustrates how these principles clarify what to do when the needs of an individual patron appear to conflict with the collective good of society.k\n\n\nEvidence\n\n\nThe following evidence from previous course work demonstrates knowledge of the codes of ethics within information professions and gives examples of complexities that often arise in trying to follow each ethical code.\n\n\n\n\nA reference interview assignment following the RUSA guidelines for LIBR 210\n\n\nA discusion post from LIBR 200 about ethical dilemmas\n\n\n\n\nLIBR 210 Reference Interview Assignment\n\n\nOne of the last assignments for the Reference and Information Services course (LIBR 210) required creating a written script of a librarian answering the question of a patron. The assignment was designed to illustrate a good reference interview involving ethical considerations following the RUSA guidelines. In the reference interview script the patron, who is a local DJ, asks the librarian to know if they are legally allowed to remix the work of other musicians into their own. The librarian has to walk a careful balance between following established ethical guidelines while also helping the patron find information to answer their information needs. Public and academic libraries often have policies that restrict librarians and staff from providing authoritative legal counsel. In this scenario the librarian wasn't able to directly answer whether the actions of the DJ were legal. Instead they shared the legal resources available in the library so that the patron would be empowered to find their own answers. The librarian was also bound by the ALA code of ethics to not express their own personal opinion about the legal matter to avoid interfering with the library's institutional aims and the patron's access to information (see \nALA Code of Ethics\n #7).\n\n\nLIBR 200 Ethical Dilemma Discussion Post\n\n\nA discussion post assignment in Information and Society (LIBR 200) explored the ethical dilemma of either blindly serving a library patron or not serving the patron when their request conflicts with the community's interests and safety. This discussion question was patterned after an experiment conducted by Robert Hauptman and reported in his symposium contribution, \nEthical Concerns in Librarianship: An Overview\n, given at the 27th annual symposium of the graduate alumni and faculty of the Rutgers School of Communication, Information, and Library Studies. The experiment looked to discover how librarians respond to a patron asking for information about building a bomb with the destructive capacity to explode a suburban home. The discussion post explains the view point that it would be unethical to blindly serve a patron without regard to any other moral obligations to other parts of the community and society. Although respect for the individual is a core ethical principle for information professionals there is also a responsibility to to the collective 'good'. This ethical dilemma illustrates that \"conflicts might occur between social responsibility and respecting the individual\" but that despite these conflicts respect for the autonomy of a patron and their individuality should be protected as long as the patron doesn't \"violate the dignity and respect of others\" (Rubin, 2010, p. 418-419)\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nThis scenario as well as other complex ethical dilemmas (e.g. item selection, copyright and intellectual property, professional conflics of interest) demonstrate the need to \"anticipate and understand the nature of ethical dilemmas likely to occur in libraries, be familiar with the ethical prescriptions of the field, and know the factors that should be considered when deliberating ethical issues\" (Rubin, 2010, p. 417). Professional codes of ethics aren't created to be used merely \nif\n ethical dilemmas occur. In our ever-changing information society information professionals will continue to face ethical dilemmas. The question is not \nif\n they will occur but \nwhen\n. Thus, it is only in understanding a professional code of ethics that an information professional can be prepared to resolve ethical dilemmas when they occur.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nALA, (2008,\u00a0January 22). \nCode of Ethics of the American Library Association\n.

            "text": "A discussion post assignment in Information and Society (LIBR 200) explored the ethical dilemma of either blindly serving a library patron or not serving the patron when their request conflicts with the community's interests and safety. This discussion question was patterned after an experiment conducted by Robert Hauptman and reported in his symposium contribution,  Ethical Concerns in Librarianship: An Overview , given at the 27th annual symposium of the graduate alumni and faculty of the Rutgers School of Communication, Information, and Library Studies. The experiment looked to discover how librarians respond to a patron asking for information about building a bomb with the destructive capacity to explode a suburban home. The discussion post explains the view point that it would be unethical to blindly serve a patron without regard to any other moral obligations to other parts of the community and society. Although respect for the individual is a core ethical principle for information professionals there is also a responsibility to to the collective 'good'. This ethical dilemma illustrates that \"conflicts might occur between social responsibility and respecting the individual\" but that despite these conflicts respect for the autonomy of a patron and their individuality should be protected as long as the patron doesn't \"violate the dignity and respect of others\" (Rubin, 2010, p. 418-419)",

Professional codes of ethics aren't created to be used merely  if  ethical dilemmas occur. In our ever-changing information society information professionals will continue to face ethical dilemmas. The question is not  if  they will occur but  when . Thus, it is only in understanding a professional code of ethics that an information professional can be prepared to resolve ethical dilemmas when they occur.",

Information professionals work in a variety of organizational environments that span many disciplines.

The information disciplines can alternatively be seen as \"meta-disciplines\" that span all other disciplines (Bates, 2015).\n\n\nAnother way to categorize the organizational settings of information professionals is by their fundamental role in society. Some organizations are designed to generate profit while others are created for non-profit aims and purposes.

Private-sector organizations include organizations seeking a profit as well as charitable organizations providing voluntary or non-profit services. \n\n\nA reflective essay assignment in LIBR 200 explores a professional association within the information profession. Professional associations are typical of non-profit organizations that support the advancement of professionals within a given field of labor. Example professional associations include the American Library Association (ALA), the American Society for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&T), International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), and the Special Libraries Association (SLA). Researching and writing about the Association of Research Libraries helps further understand this type of organizational setting and the type of work performed by information professionals.\n\n\nThe nature of the organization influences the missions, aims, and goals of the organization's members and employees. This also influences the type of work performed by information professionals. Strategic planning is an essential tool to guide and shape the environment and direction of an organization. The practice of information professionals within organizations is directly affected by the organization's mission, aims, values, and goals. A semester-long project to develop a strategic plan for an existing public library was valuable to understand the organizational setting where public library staff practice their craft.\n\n\nThe library can be seen as a type of information organization. Libraries can be classified into various types including public libraries, school libraries, and special libraries including museums and archives. Public libraries are created and funded by local communities and municipalities. In addition to providing access to books, magazines, newspapers they also can provide access to films, music, and other information resources and events relevant to their community. School libraries are connected to K-12 schools and their school district systems. The types of resources available in these libraries and the work performed by information professionals are largely determined by the school board and school district's policies. These types of libraries support school curriculum and students in the school. Special libraries provide access to specialized information materials within a specific domain or area of expertise. These types of libraries include medical and law libraries, government libraries, and libraries tied to a corporation, non-profit organization, or museum. These libraries aim to serve a specific target audience whose information needs align with the materials available in the library. \n\n\nAcademic libraries are another specific type of organizational setting. While academic libraries share common ancestral roots with public libraries, school libraries, and special libraries the academic library stands on its own as a distinct organizational setting with its own set of opportunities and challenges for information professionals. Academic libraries are connected to a higher education institution. The work performed by information professionals in academic libraries is designed to support the study and research of students and faculty attending the institution. Working in the \nHarold B.

Professional associations are important to the organizational setting of information professionals because of their role in providing a support network that connects together similar organizations. This support network gives practitioners access to resources and tools that can help them accomplish their work that would be hard to find and discover on their own. This reflective essay focuses on the \nARL\n. \n\n\nStarted in 1932 by 42 university and research library directors the ARL is a non-profit library association that currently includes 125 research libraries. The association's core principles and mission center are built upon open access to information, research libraries as a major source of knowledge to society, identifying and acting on emerging trends, and meeting the needs of the communities served by each research library. Like many professional associations, ARL acts like connective tissue linking library and information organizations with similar goals and initiatives. The work done by the ARL and its member research libraries establish industry standards, policies, and best practices for information professionals that help them better serve their patron's and communities.\n\n\nLIBR 204 Strategic Planning Project\n\n\nAn information professional's organizational setting is shaped and influenced by many forces both intentional and unintentional. Strategic planning is the organizational process that strives to shape and direct the mission, vision, and values of an organization and its members. It also includes environmental scanning and analyzing the organization's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT). This planning process and the implementation of that plan also shape the organizational setting of information professionals. \n\n\nA two-phase, semester-long group project in LIBR 204 included formulating a strategic plan for the Hingham Public Library in Hingham, Massachusetts. This project explored the framework that assists in defining the organizational setting for public library staff and librarians. Phase one in the project included a literature review about environmental scanning, creating the public library's mission, vision, and values statement, an environmental scan of the library, and SWOT analysis. Elements of phase one were used to formulate and present a strategic plan for the library. \n\n\nThis project reveals the organizational setting of a public library and the importance of carefully choosing and following its mission, vision, and values. It shows the need for library staff to accurately identify the organization's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. \"Organizations must be designed to be flexible so they can adapt to change\" and increase involvement and communication between management and various departments within the organization (Huffman, 2004, p. 48). This project also demonstrates that the work performed in this public library is a valuable and relevant part of the library's local community. The work and responsibilities of library staff directly contribute to achieving the library's mission, vision, and values. \n\n\nLibrary Employee Directory Entry\n\n\nWorking as a Data Services Engineer within the HBLL on the BYU campus illuminates the setting where academic library staff work. The library hosts a variety of software products including software developed in-house as well as software purchased from third-party vendors. Library staff and faculty depend daily on this software to help them accomplish their tasks to purchase, catalog, share, and assess library services and offerings for students and faculty on campus. The library \ncourse reserve and copyright system\n was recently overhauled to support providing faculty hard copy and electronic items that they can use in their classroom teaching.\n\n\nSoftware developed and supported within the HBLL also includes products used by students and faculty at the university. The \nlibrary catalog and discovery systems\n are searchable and browsable via the library website. This gives students and faculty access to find and checkout both physical and electronic items. The library website also ties together \nsubject guides\n developed and curated by librarians that students and faculty use for their assignments and research. The HBLL also includes the \nL. Tom Perry Special Collections\n which houses a wide range of archival materials unique to the university community and research foci. The \nsystem\n used by Special Collections to create and share XML-based finding aids is developed and maintained by the library software developers. These software tools and systems give a backstage view to the dynamic work performed by library faculty and staff. \n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nInformation professionals practice in a variety of organizational settings. Some work directly with emerging technologies and trends. Information organizations in today's society require employees to keep pace with the evolving work skills and requirements. Professional associations connect information professionals to a network of other professionals in the same domain of work. Through these associations information professionals receive skills, best practices, and resources to accomplish their work responsibilities and meet the needs of their communities. Strategic planning is another part of an organization's setting that influences the work and focus of information professionals within the organization. An organization's mission, vision, and values create a framework that information professionals work within and use to help meet the needs of those they serve. The work of an academic library spans multiple disciplines and supports the learning and research of both students and faculty. Academic libraries and their staff work hard to keep pace with current information tends and research areas. Working within the library information technology (LIT) division gives an interesting view into the tools and workflows of library staff as they work towards meeting the information needs of library patrons.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAbout ARL (2013).

As technological advancements and societal progress expands our knowledge about the world and its inhabitants one becomes increasingly aware of the diversity that exists in the world. Diversity can be found in various aspects of clientele or employees within a library or information organization. Patrons and employees vary in appearance, physical ability, ethnicity, cultural backgrounds and norms, immigrant status, religious affiliation, gender, education, employment, economic status, and housing. \n\n\nIn addition to recognizing the diversity that exists within patrons and employees is the need for information organizations to act in ways that help them better understand and reflect this diversity. The \nALA Policy Manual\n for diversity states:\n\n\n\"Libraries can and should play a crucial role in empowering diverse populations for full participation in a democratic society. In order to accomplish this, however, libraries must utilize multivariate resources and strategies. In the library workforce, concrete programs of recruitment, training, development, advancement and promotion are needed in order to increase and retain diverse library personnel who are reflective of the society we serve\" (ALA, 2016). \n\n\nExperiences within the SJSU School of Information MLIS program reinforced the need to recognize and reflect the diversity that exists among an information organization's patrons and employees. A discussion post in LIBR 200 about professional library associations demonstrates an understanding of the value of giving information organizations and information professionals a support network where they can meet others doing similar work but from the context of their own diverse background and circumstances. An essay assignment in LIBR 204 examined qualities of a great leadership by looking at the experience and work of a leader within the library and information profession. Research for this assignment led to understanding that diversity within a team becomes an asset and advantage when the team works towards a unified goal. Helping to meet the needs of blind patrons was the focus of a discussion posting in LIBR 210. This posting shed light on the need to recognize patrons within minority groups and the broader issue of how an information organization can best meet the needs of these underserved populations. A semester-long strategic planning project in LIBR 204 about an existing public library revealed the need for information organizations to develop cultural and ecomomic competency to help them better serve their diverse communities (Evans and Ward, 2007, p. 46).\n\n\nEvidence\n\n\nThe following evidence from previous course work demonstrate an understanding of the diversity among patrons and employees of information organizations as well as actions that can be taken by the organization to reflect that diversity.\n\n\n\n\nA discussion post about the value of diverse backgrounds and experience coming together within professional associations.\n\n\nAn essay about great leadership demonstrating the value of diversity in helping groups accomplish great things.\n\n\nA discussion posting about meeting the needs of underserved populations. \n\n\nA strategic planning project showing the diversity within a public library.\n\n\n\n\nLIBR 200 Discussion post: Professional Library Associations\n\n\nProfessional Library Associations give information professionals an opportunity to join a community where they can share ideas, solutions, best practices, job experiences, and job openings. Researching about these associations and writing a discussion post on the research findings demonstrates the diversity present in a professional association and how this diversity can lead to improving everyone. Although the community shares a similar set of professional interests and pursuits the network of information professionals come from diverse cultural and economic backgrounds. Associating with information professionals from diverse backgrounds and settings gives opportunities to learn from each other and see new perspectives that were previously unknown or unfamiliar. Information organizations can encourage their employees to join and participate in a professional library association. This encouragement promotes the value and benefits of diversity to the organization's employees and its surrounding community by ensuring more broadly skilled and trained professionals who effectively serve the needs of the community.\n\n\nLIBR 204 Essay: Good to Great\n\n\nAn information organization faces the challenge of uniting a diverse group of professionals around a shared vision all can support and trust. Great leaders exhibit the qualities that unite a team or organization around a common purpose and vision. They put the mission of the organization first before themselves or anything else. This assignment looked at the leadership qualities exhibited by Daniel J. Cohen the current executive director of the \nDigital Public Library of America (DPLA)\n.\n\n\nCohen has spent most of his professional career on digital and computer technology-focused initiatives and projects. Like a film director leading a diverse group of professional staff to create a unique and worthwhile film, Cohen directs projects with \"a core belief that large-scale initiatives involving technology are actually \nsocial\n projects. That is, successful digital projects mainly involve getting diverse people working together towards an ideal\" (Enis, 2013). Researching and writing about Cohen shows that diversity can be an asset in accomplishing group projects and tasks rather than an obstacle. Rather than ignoring diversity that exists within an information organization Cohen respects and embraces that diversity knowing that it will lead to creating a better product and service. \n\n\nLIBR 210 Discussion Post: Underserved Populations\n\n\nVisual impairment is a significant obstacle to full participation within society and access to information. The visually impaired are an example population that is typically underserved by information organizations. Because so much of what an information organization provides is visual in nature this group can go unnoticed and poorly served. The visually impaired are a diverse population among patrons of an information organization. They deserve service that enables their full participation and access to information just as those without any visual impairment. \n\n\nResearching and writing this discussion post demonstrated the need for information organizations and their employees to find ways that will better serve the visually impaired. Supervisors and managers need to recognize this underserved population and ensure that their employees within the organization have all the resources required to provide high quality service to these patrons. This includes the time, money, and tools so that information professionals within the organization can develop the skills and training to acquire, implement, and maintain the resources and technologies that are used by the visually impaired. When an information organization addresses the needs of all in the community with a high level of service these underserved populations can change to being well-served patrons that feel included and a part of the community.\n\n\nLIBR 204 Strategic Planning Project\n\n\nThere are many ways for an information organization to improve the organization's \"cultural competency\" (Evans and Ward, 2007, p. 46). Strategic planning is a key way that employees and leaders of an organization use to set the priorities and focus of the organization. A strategic planning project for LIBR 204 involved creating a strategic plan for an existing public library. This involved researching the library and its community as well as the process of creating a strategic plan.\n\n\nThis research process made clear the need to identify, understand, and embrace the diversity that exists within the public library and its surrounding community. An information organization that doesn't consider the \"\u2026values, attitudes, demographics, historic context, and customs of the society in which the organization operates\" (Evans and Ward, 2007, p. 46) will fail to see things as they really are and as they really will be. A failure to see the truth about an organization's cultural and economic contexts will lead to the organization failing to serve and meet the needs of its employees, patrons, and community which in turn could lead to the end of the organization itself. Understanding and embracing this diversity within an organization's missions, vision, and goals shapes the routine decisions and habits of the organization's staff. One example of this influence is acquisitions and collection development. An information organization that understands the diversity that exists within its patron's and their needs will provide a diverse collection of books, magazines, music, and video that directly meet patron's needs and provide all patrons with the best possible experience. Another example is understanding the economic situation of the library's local community. Like the Hingham Public Library many information organizations are part of a local community with unemployed or low income workers. An information organization can better serve these economically diverse patron groups by offering programs and services that help them find jobs and improve their employable work skills. \n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nA fundamental ideal within library and information science is to provide equal access to information for everyone regardless of the differences that exists within society. Providing society equal access to information is social in nature. This involves working with other professional colleagues and with the organization's clientele in a way that acknowledges, respects, and celebrates their diversity. Working within an environment where diversity of culture, economic status, education, professional skill, and thought are understood, appreciated, and embraced gives expanded perspective and vision that is more empathetic and effective in meeting the needs of the community. Taking the time to interact with and serve others of different cultural, economic, academic, or professional backgrounds is an opportunity to ensure all feel welcomed and empowered for \"full participation in a democratic society\" (ALA, 2016). Coursework completed in the MLIS program demonstrates the synergy that results in embracing the diversity within information organizations and their clientele. \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nALA (2016).

            "text": "The third core competency is to  \"recognize the diversity (such as cultural and economic) in the clientele and employees of an information organization and be familiar with actions the organization should take to address this diversity\" . As technological advancements and societal progress expands our knowledge about the world and its inhabitants one becomes increasingly aware of the diversity that exists in the world. Diversity can be found in various aspects of clientele or employees within a library or information organization. Patrons and employees vary in appearance, physical ability, ethnicity, cultural backgrounds and norms, immigrant status, religious affiliation, gender, education, employment, economic status, and housing.   In addition to recognizing the diversity that exists within patrons and employees is the need for information organizations to act in ways that help them better understand and reflect this diversity. The  ALA Policy Manual  for diversity states:  \"Libraries can and should play a crucial role in empowering diverse populations for full participation in a democratic society. In order to accomplish this, however, libraries must utilize multivariate resources and strategies. In the library workforce, concrete programs of recruitment, training, development, advancement and promotion are needed in order to increase and retain diverse library personnel who are reflective of the society we serve\" (ALA, 2016).   Experiences within the SJSU School of Information MLIS program reinforced the need to recognize and reflect the diversity that exists among an information organization's patrons and employees. A discussion post in LIBR 200 about professional library associations demonstrates an understanding of the value of giving information organizations and information professionals a support network where they can meet others doing similar work but from the context of their own diverse background and circumstances. An essay assignment in LIBR 204 examined qualities of a great leadership by looking at the experience and work of a leader within the library and information profession. Research for this assignment led to understanding that diversity within a team becomes an asset and advantage when the team works towards a unified goal. Helping to meet the needs of blind patrons was the focus of a discussion posting in LIBR 210. This posting shed light on the need to recognize patrons within minority groups and the broader issue of how an information organization can best meet the needs of these underserved populations. A semester-long strategic planning project in LIBR 204 about an existing public library revealed the need for information organizations to develop cultural and ecomomic competency to help them better serve their diverse communities (Evans and Ward, 2007, p. 46).",

Although the community shares a similar set of professional interests and pursuits the network of information professionals come from diverse cultural and economic backgrounds. Associating with information professionals from diverse backgrounds and settings gives opportunities to learn from each other and see new perspectives that were previously unknown or unfamiliar. Information organizations can encourage their employees to join and participate in a professional library association. This encouragement promotes the value and benefits of diversity to the organization's employees and its surrounding community by ensuring more broadly skilled and trained professionals who effectively serve the needs of the community.",

This assignment looked at the leadership qualities exhibited by Daniel J. Cohen the current executive director of the  Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) .  Cohen has spent most of his professional career on digital and computer technology-focused initiatives and projects. Like a film director leading a diverse group of professional staff to create a unique and worthwhile film, Cohen directs projects with \"a core belief that large-scale initiatives involving technology are actually  social  projects. That is, successful digital projects mainly involve getting diverse people working together towards an ideal\" (Enis, 2013). Researching and writing about Cohen shows that diversity can be an asset in accomplishing group projects and tasks rather than an obstacle. Rather than ignoring diversity that exists within an information organization Cohen respects and embraces that diversity knowing that it will lead to creating a better product and service.",

They deserve service that enables their full participation and access to information just as those without any visual impairment.   Researching and writing this discussion post demonstrated the need for information organizations and their employees to find ways that will better serve the visually impaired. Supervisors and managers need to recognize this underserved population and ensure that their employees within the organization have all the resources required to provide high quality service to these patrons. This includes the time, money, and tools so that information professionals within the organization can develop the skills and training to acquire, implement, and maintain the resources and technologies that are used by the visually impaired.

            "text": "There are many ways for an information organization to improve the organization's \"cultural competency\" (Evans and Ward, 2007, p. 46). Strategic planning is a key way that employees and leaders of an organization use to set the priorities and focus of the organization. A strategic planning project for LIBR 204 involved creating a strategic plan for an existing public library. This involved researching the library and its community as well as the process of creating a strategic plan.  This research process made clear the need to identify, understand, and embrace the diversity that exists within the public library and its surrounding community. An information organization that doesn't consider the \"\u2026values, attitudes, demographics, historic context, and customs of the society in which the organization operates\" (Evans and Ward, 2007, p. 46) will fail to see things as they really are and as they really will be. A failure to see the truth about an organization's cultural and economic contexts will lead to the organization failing to serve and meet the needs of its employees, patrons, and community which in turn could lead to the end of the organization itself.

            "text": "Competency D\n\n\nThe fourth competency requires demonstrating that one can \n\"apply the fundamental principles of planning, management, marketing, and advocacy;\"\n. Planning, management, marketing, and advocacy are essential components of a successful information organization. Commonly considered within the context of private and for-profit businesses, these components can also be applied to public and non-profit information organizations contexts. \n\n\nPlanning (or strategic planning) is the process that connects an organization's mission, aims, and vision with the actions and results of the organization. Whether by intention or not it is appropriate that planning is listed first in this competency as planning establishes the framework to support the organization's management, marketing, and advocacy efforts. Planning assesses the organization by looking at the  organization's past, present, and future, and identifying and analyzing the internal and external forces surrounding the organization. It also helps assess the organization's identity and role both to internal staff and employees as well as to the organization's patron's, clientele, and community. The organization's missions, vision, goals, priorities, service offerings, tasks, and actions are all influenced by this planning process. \n\n\nBenefits of planning include new questions, perspectives, and ideas that help the organization's staff and leadership see the organization as it really is and not as they want it to be. Planning also helps in managing the organization's staff and resources as well as fundraising and budgeting. Planning assists in unifying and focusing the organization's staff on a common vision that all commit to following. Having a strategic plan also gives the organization a clear path for delegating responsibilities and tasks so that all in the organization are empowered to contribute their part for good of the whole.\n\n\nManagement refers to the responsibility and control of the organization and its staff. Management uses the organization's mission, vision, goals, and priorities to establish what work and services the organization will provide. It also includes making financial, hiring, and marketing decisions as well as assessing the performance of the organization's work and services. A key of management is establishing an environment of great leadership and loyal trust among all employees of the organization. It involves working with others in teams, groups, and committees towards the common mission, values, and goals of the organization. \n\n\nMarketing is about promoting the organization and its offerings. Marketing is about persuading patrons that the products offered by the organization and its staff is worth their time and attention. While information organizations may not produce physical goods themselves, products offered by an information organization include services, people, the organization itself, and ideas (Kotler and Levy, 1969, p. 12). Marketing applies broadly to all organizational activity from organizations of all types including public and non-profit organizations. It can only be avoided by the organization at the peril of the organization's relevance and existence (Kotler and Levy, 1969, p. 15). \n\n\nA sister to marketing is advocacy which is about generating public support for the information organization and its offerings. Like marketing advocacy can be used by an organization to demonstrate the value and benefit of the organization to its patrons and community. Successful advocacy efforts lead to increased use and loyalty by patrons of the organization. Advocacy can also lead to increased  fundraising for the organization ensuring its long-term existence. \n\n\nEvidence\n\n\nThe following evidence from previous course work demonstrate the application of planning, management, marketing, and advocacy. \n\n\n\n\nA semester-long research project developing a strategic plan for a public library. \n\n\nA discussion post about leadership and trust\n\n\nA discussion post about budgets and financial management\n\n\nA discussion post about team and group work\n\n\nA library conference proposal assignment\n\n\nAn evaluation of a library website's effective marketing\n\n\n\n\nLIBR 204 Strategic Planning Project\n\n\nA two-phase, semester-long group project in LIBR 204 included formulating a strategic plan for the Hingham Public Library in Hingham, Massachusetts. Phase one in the project included a literature review about the process of strategic planning and environmental scanning, creating the public library's mission, vision, and values statement, an environmental scan of the library, and SWOT analysis. Elements of phase one were used to formulate and present a strategic plan for the library (phase two). This strategic plan was compiled and \npresented in Prezi format\n. \n\n\nResearching and developing a strategic plan for the Hingham Public Library gave first-hand experience with the planning process. The current mission, vision, and goals of the library were evaluated. An environmental scan including a SWOT analysis was conducted for the library. These aspects of the process revealed insights into the role the library played in the community. The planning process helped in calibrating the library's mission, values, and goals with the needs of its patrons and surrounding community. \n\n\nWhile the project content offered a chance to apply the principles of planning the group work for the project provided a first-hand experience with management principles including leadership, team work, goal setting, follow-up, delegation, and assessment. One person alone could not have accomplished the project. It required communicating clearly and effectively with each team member about the project requirements and goals. Regularly scheduled meetings with the group helped assess the project's progress, review accomplished work, and assign out remaining tasks. Working together to manage our time and resources individually and for the group was a key to successfully creating a strategic plan for the library. \n\n\nLIBR 204 Discussion Post: Leadership and Trust\n\n\nThis discussion post demonstrates the truth that leadership and trust are vital principles of management within an organization. Within information organizations leadership can tend to be less concentrated. This type of leadership has been referred to as \"legislative leadership\" which \"relies more upon persuasion, political currency, and shared interests\" to foster correct decision making (Collins, 2005, p. 11). Leadership is about the relationship between leader and follower, not the sum of an individual's traits, skills, and decisions (M. Fairholm and G. Fairholm, 2000, p. 108). Trust plays a crucial role in establishing the nature the of relationship between leader and follower. \n\n\nResearch for the discussion post identified obstacles to creating trust between leader and follower. These obstacles include poor communication, apathy, alienation, selfishness, pride, lack of sensitivity towards others, domineering organizational authority structure, lack of accountability, and decaying moral values (i.e. honesty, integrity, commitment) are internal and external obstacles to establishing a trusting relationship between leader and follower. The obstacles of trust show that the organization's culture plays a more critical role in solving issues between leader and follower than the structure of the organization. The power of an organization to make unified decisions derives from the trust established between leader and follower. By correctly identifying weaknesses in the trust between leaders and followers an organization can work towards improving this relationship so that leader and follower work together with trust and respect. \n\n\nLIBR 204 Discussion Post: Budgets and Financial Management\n\n\nThis discussion post provided an opportunity to apply principles of management to a scenario commonly faced by library directors: being asked by the city council to reduce the public library's operating budget by 20%. The solution presented in the discussion post included plans to reduce the budget by 10% and increase revenue by 10%. The plan involved assessing all library services and expenditures in the light of their value to both library staff, patrons, and the local community. With feedback from the library staff, patrons, and community the library services could be ranked in order of most to least value. Programs and services with little value would be targets to cut. \n\n\nIncreasing the budget by 10% involved identifying new \"revenue centers\" (Evans and Ward, 2007, p. 409-410) that can generate income for the library. These could include working with the library's friends group to generate money through the sale of duplicate or unneeded library items and equipment as well as creating a library membership service that allows donors the ability to contribute funds on a subscription service. Another source of revenue could be to rent out conference rooms in the library for local groups or organizations. Applying the principles related to management in this discussion posting revealed the importance of making budgetary decisions one that includes participation with library staff, patrons, and the local community. Working together in transparent ways ensures that all needs will be met in the most effective way possible.\n\n\nLIBR 204 Discussion Post: Team and Group Work\n\n\nWithin information organizations the principles related to planning, management, marketing, and advocacy are social in nature. They cannot be accomplished by a single individual. They necessitate working with others in teams and groups. A discussion posting in LIBR 204 illustrates the difference between committees and teams. Committees lack authority and autonomy to make decisions and create a product. In contrast members of a team have \u201chave independence over how they're going to address the problem or issue that they've been given\u201d (Haycock, 2007). With greater autonomy comes greater responsibility and accountability in accomplishing the goals of the team. Multiple classes in the MLIS program provided opportunities to apply these principles. This group experience shows that the keys to a successful team are unity in purpose and individual accountability. \n\n\nINFO 220 Library Conference Proposal\n\n\nInformation organizations have many opportunities for marketing and advocacy. An assignment for a class about Digital Humanities (DH) and the library (INFO 220) addressed an opportunity to market and advocate the value and benefit academic libraries have in the field of DH. DH and DH scholarship refer to a broad range of scholarly activities that explore the intersection of computing and the humanities. \n\n\nThe assignment involved creating a conference proposal to explore the intersections of academic libraries and DH scholarship. The conference proposal included descriptions of a keynote presentation and three break-out sessions. The keynote presentation focuses on a statement by Charles William Eliot, the president of Harvard University in the late 19th century, that the library is the heart of the university and therefore asks if the academic library is at the heart of DH. The first session looks at how the academic library provides opportunities for learning DH-related skills and techniques through library instruction and teaching. The role of the library in data creation and maintenance is the topic of the second conference session. The third session explores the role the library plays in collaboration between library staff and DH scholars in the local community. Holding a DH conference at an academic library provides the opportunity to market the library and its strengths to other university scholars. The conference proposal also includes a conference advertisement as well as \na video summary of the proposal\n. This conference proposal was a hands-on project to apply principles of marketing that generate awareness of the programs, services, and offerings the academic library has to the local scholarly community. \n\n\nLIBR 204 Discussion Post: Marketing\n\n\nMarketing is used by an information organization to showcase to its community the various services provided as well as stimulate the community's use of these services (Evans and Ward, 2007, p. 96). New emerging technologies give information organizations new ways to market and advocate their products and offerings. Computer networking technologies including the World Wide Web expand an information organization's reach to communities and audiences throughout the world. A discussion post in LIBR 204 asked to evaluate the effective use of marketing by an information organization's website. This discussion post evaluated the \nwebsite for the Harold B. Lee Library (HBLL)\n at Brigham Young University. The HBLL website was found to be a strong example of effective marketing that helps build the relationship between the library and the university community. The HBLL website accomplishes this by the it's design and visual hierarchy that emphasizes activities relevant to the library's patrons and potential new patrons. Hyperlinks at the top of the main page link to library events and exhibits that tie into the university's focus of life-long learning and service. A large search field is displayed prominently at the top and center of the page that invites finding physical and electronic materials and services offered by the library. Sections on the right and bottom of the page highlight the library's hours of operation as well as library events ands news announcements. This assignment provided the opportunity to see how a library website uses principles of marketing to build its relationship with it's university and scholarly communities. The HBLL website design has successfully marketed and advocated its services and programs as the library has seen an increase in the physical and digital offerings of the library. \n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nInformation organizations face the brutal fact that they must change and innovate or risk obsolescence and failure. This necessity for change and innovation depends heavily upon effective decision making (Evans and Ward, 2007, p. 107, 121). Effective decision making within an information organization includes appropriately applying the principles of planning, management, marketing, and advocacy. \n\n\nAssignments completed in the SJSU MLIS program offered opportunities to apply principles of planning that set the course and direction of an information organization. Developing a strategic plan for a public library gave hands-on experience with principles of leadership, team work, communication, goal setting, delegation, assessment, and accountability. Course work also showed how the principles of leadership and trust create a management culture within an information organization that helps staff and leaders work together in unity. Management also includes making hard financial decisions for the information organization as well as working together in teams and committees. These examples show the essential nature of team work, collaboration, and transparent communication in strengthening the relationship between the information organization and its staff as well as between the organization and its community. Marketing is defined as \"a process of exchange and a way to foster the partnership between the library and its community (Weingand, 1995, p. 296). Advocacy works together with marketing to promote support for the library and its services. Hosting a conference as well as using new computuer and network technologies an information organization can find creative ways to connect with their patrons and community in a way that constructively builds this relationship. Planning, management, marketing, and advocacy are powerful tools to help an information organization evolve and adapt so that the organization can more effectively meet the needs of their staff and patrons.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCollins, J.

The planning process helped in calibrating the library's mission, values, and goals with the needs of its patrons and surrounding community.   While the project content offered a chance to apply the principles of planning the group work for the project provided a first-hand experience with management principles including leadership, team work, goal setting, follow-up, delegation, and assessment. One person alone could not have accomplished the project. It required communicating clearly and effectively with each team member about the project requirements and goals. Regularly scheduled meetings with the group helped assess the project's progress, review accomplished work, and assign out remaining tasks. Working together to manage our time and resources individually and for the group was a key to successfully creating a strategic plan for the library.",

            "text": "This discussion post demonstrates the truth that leadership and trust are vital principles of management within an organization. Within information organizations leadership can tend to be less concentrated. This type of leadership has been referred to as \"legislative leadership\" which \"relies more upon persuasion, political currency, and shared interests\" to foster correct decision making (Collins, 2005, p. 11). Leadership is about the relationship between leader and follower, not the sum of an individual's traits, skills, and decisions (M. Fairholm and G. Fairholm, 2000, p. 108). Trust plays a crucial role in establishing the nature the of relationship between leader and follower.   Research for the discussion post identified obstacles to creating trust between leader and follower. These obstacles include poor communication, apathy, alienation, selfishness, pride, lack of sensitivity towards others, domineering organizational authority structure, lack of accountability, and decaying moral values (i.e. honesty, integrity, commitment) are internal and external obstacles to establishing a trusting relationship between leader and follower. The obstacles of trust show that the organization's culture plays a more critical role in solving issues between leader and follower than the structure of the organization. The power of an organization to make unified decisions derives from the trust established between leader and follower. By correctly identifying weaknesses in the trust between leaders and followers an organization can work towards improving this relationship so that leader and follower work together with trust and respect.",

The solution presented in the discussion post included plans to reduce the budget by 10% and increase revenue by 10%. The plan involved assessing all library services and expenditures in the light of their value to both library staff, patrons, and the local community. With feedback from the library staff, patrons, and community the library services could be ranked in order of most to least value. Programs and services with little value would be targets to cut.   Increasing the budget by 10% involved identifying new \"revenue centers\" (Evans and Ward, 2007, p. 409-410) that can generate income for the library. These could include working with the library's friends group to generate money through the sale of duplicate or unneeded library items and equipment as well as creating a library membership service that allows donors the ability to contribute funds on a subscription service. Another source of revenue could be to rent out conference rooms in the library for local groups or organizations. Applying the principles related to management in this discussion posting revealed the importance of making budgetary decisions one that includes participation with library staff, patrons, and the local community. Working together in transparent ways ensures that all needs will be met in the most effective way possible.",

An assignment for a class about Digital Humanities (DH) and the library (INFO 220) addressed an opportunity to market and advocate the value and benefit academic libraries have in the field of DH. DH and DH scholarship refer to a broad range of scholarly activities that explore the intersection of computing and the humanities.   The assignment involved creating a conference proposal to explore the intersections of academic libraries and DH scholarship. The conference proposal included descriptions of a keynote presentation and three break-out sessions. The keynote presentation focuses on a statement by Charles William Eliot, the president of Harvard University in the late 19th century, that the library is the heart of the university and therefore asks if the academic library is at the heart of DH. The first session looks at how the academic library provides opportunities for learning DH-related skills and techniques through library instruction and teaching. The role of the library in data creation and maintenance is the topic of the second conference session. The third session explores the role the library plays in collaboration between library staff and DH scholars in the local community. Holding a DH conference at an academic library provides the opportunity to market the library and its strengths to other university scholars. The conference proposal also includes a conference advertisement as well as  a video summary of the proposal .

This necessity for change and innovation depends heavily upon effective decision making (Evans and Ward, 2007, p. 107, 121). Effective decision making within an information organization includes appropriately applying the principles of planning, management, marketing, and advocacy.   Assignments completed in the SJSU MLIS program offered opportunities to apply principles of planning that set the course and direction of an information organization. Developing a strategic plan for a public library gave hands-on experience with principles of leadership, team work, communication, goal setting, delegation, assessment, and accountability. Course work also showed how the principles of leadership and trust create a management culture within an information organization that helps staff and leaders work together in unity. Management also includes making hard financial decisions for the information organization as well as working together in teams and committees. These examples show the essential nature of team work, collaboration, and transparent communication in strengthening the relationship between the information organization and its staff as well as between the organization and its community. Marketing is defined as \"a process of exchange and a way to foster the partnership between the library and its community (Weingand, 1995, p. 296). Advocacy works together with marketing to promote support for the library and its services. Hosting a conference as well as using new computuer and network technologies an information organization can find creative ways to connect with their patrons and community in a way that constructively builds this relationship. Planning, management, marketing, and advocacy are powerful tools to help an information organization evolve and adapt so that the organization can more effectively meet the needs of their staff and patrons.",

            "text": "Competency E\n\n\nThe fifth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to \n\"design, query, and evaluate information retrieval systems\"\n. Information retrieval (IR) is the process of finding information resources that answer a particular information need by searching a collection of stored data. An information retrieval system (IR system) is a system designed to help search and find specific information from one or more stored data repositories. Harter (1986) defined an IR system as \"a device interposed between a potential end-user of an information collection and the information collection itself\" (p. 2). \n\n\nIR systems are composed of two basic components: 1) the database that stores the data and 2) a mechanism for retrieving information out of the database. The term database refers to the structured set of data stored in a way that facilitates information retrieval. IR systems can be analog or digital in nature. The library can be considered a type of IR system (Rubin, 2010, p. 127). Printed indexes and bibliographies are other examples of analog IR systems. Since the late 20th century computer and networking technologies have replaced many analog IR systems with digital or electronic systems. Bibliographic records have been converted into digital formats including the MARC (machine readable cataloging) and BIBFRAME (Bibliographic Framework) record formats. These digital record formats enable computers to store, connect, parse, and retrieve bibliographic information in more automated, efficient ways than possible using analog formats. The online public access catalog (OPAC) is an electronic IR system that can store and retrieve bibliographic information for use by an information organization. While originally designed as an electronic replacement of the analog library card catalog system OPACs have developed into sophisticated IR systems with improved search and discovery technologies that information organizations rely on for access to physical and electronic resources. Web search engines are another type of electronic IR system. The development and now ubiquity of the World Wide Web has afforded the creation of web search engines to help end-users search for information available on the World Wide Web.\n\n\nThe design, querying, and evaluation of an IR system are based upon the system's ability to match information from the IR system with the end-user's information need. Designing an IR system begins with identifying the intended end-users of the system. Knowing who will use the system leads to identifying their information needs and shapes what and how data is entered into the IR system. The design of an IR system also includes identifying and developing controlled vocabularies, keywords, and indexes of the data in the system to facilitate efficient information retrieval. Querying refers to an end-user's interaction with an IR system by entering search queries and terms relevant to their information need. The aim of an IR system is to return (or retrieve) information from the system that is most relevant to the end-user's information needs.\n\n\nEvaluating an IR system assesses the effectiveness of the system to meet the information needs of end-users. An effective IR system distinguishes between relevant and non-relevant documents in the IR system's collection of data. Precision and recall are two basic measures for information retrieval effectiveness (Kerry, Kent, and Berry, 1955). Precision is the ratio of relevant items retrieved to all retrieved items. It is the number of correct results that match the search query divided by the number of all items returned by the search. Recall is the ratio of relevant items retrieved to all relevant items in the IR system's collection. It is the number of correct results divided by the number of items that should have been returned by the search query. An IR system with high precision returns more relevant items than non-relevant items. A system with high recall means that the system returns a majority of the relevant items. An IR system should optimize for precision or recall based on the information needs of the system's end-users. Some end users may want the IR system to have high recall and will tolerate low precision to ensure they get everything that could be relevant. Other end users may expect the IR system to return the most relevant items first (high precision) while disregarding about the entire set of items retrieved (low recall). Coursework and projects in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program provided opportunities to design, query, and evaluate IR systems. \n\n\nEvidence\n\n\nThe following evidence from previous course work demonstrate experience in designing, querying, and evaluating information retrieval systems. \n\n\n\n\nReflective essay about information retrieval systems\n\n\nTwo-part database design group project\n\n\nResearch paper about Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and information retrieval \n\n\nSeries of assignments to practice querying various academic databases\n\n\n\n\nLIBR 200: Reflective Essay on Information Retrieval Systems\n\n\nTo effectively design, use, and evaluate information retrieval systems requires a basic knowledge and understanding of information retrieval systems and their value within library and information science. A reflective essay exploring the definition of an information retrieval system and various examples of analog and digital systems helped establish this basic level of understanding and knowledge. The essay also provided examples of information retrieval systems that were familiar from previous experience and use. This includes a library catalog and library classification system, the phone book, printed indexes and bibliographies, internet search engines, online shopping websites, online data portals and data warehouses, and online mapping websites like MapQuest and Google Maps. Knowing and using a variety of information retrieval systems prepares the librarian or information scientist to answer the information needs of patrons and clientele of their organizations.\n\n\nLIBR 202: Database Design Group Project\n\n\nA two-part group project explored designing information retrieval systems. The first part of the project required creating a hypothetical collection of items useful to a specified user group and set of information needs. A database table was created to model the information stored for each item or record in the collection. The collection's unit of description was chosen for how users would search the collection's database. The group decided on creating a database to store metadata about a collection of Star Trek action figures manufactured by the fictional ACME TOY company. The first step in designing an information retrieval system is to identify the purpose of the retrieval system. This also included describing the main intended user group of the retrieval system and their information needs. A set of possible questions was formulated for potential users of the database. Based on the user group and their needs the database structure was designed. Field names and field types were chosen to capture the essential fields of data for each item in the collection. After determining the names, types, rules, and standards for each field online database software (i.e. WebData Pro) was used to create a database following this record and field structure. A set of hypothetical data was created and entered into the database. This allowed the group to test searching the database to determine how well the database met the needs of the intended user group. \n\n\nThe second part of the project involved evaluating another group's database design project from the class. Evaluting the database design included answering the following questions:\n\n\n\n\nIs the database design appropriate for the collection?\n\n\nHow well do they provide for consistent description of items?\n\n\nIs the design sufficient to meet the users' needs?\n\n\nHow well do they accommodate exceptions?\n\n\nWere the design rules adequately implemented and enforced in their database implementation?\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to providing experience evaluating an information retrieval system, the second part of this project helped understand what is required to effectively design a retrieval system. A well designed information retrieval system has a clear intent and purpose. Items or records in the system are structured and described with useful information that meets the needs of the system's intended user group. The structure of the database also needs to be robust in accounting for exceptions and variations in the data that is modeled in the retrieval system. Effectively designed information retrieval systems make it easy for data entry as well as for users of the system to find information that matches their needs. \n\n\nLIBR 202: Research Paper about GIS and Information Retrieval\n\n\nLiving in a information age with advanced digital computing and networking technologies there are massive amounts and varieties of information created each day. One type of digital information that continues to increase in quantity and value is geospatial information (also referred to as spatial or geographic information). Geospatial information is information that is tied to a physical location on earth. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a collection of components designed to create, manage, store, and retrieve geospatial information. A GIS enables spatial analyses and data visualizations of the geographic data within the system. Understanding and evaluting geographic information systems makes it possible for librarians or information scientists to better meet the geographic information needs of their patrons and clientele. \n\n\nGIS in an information organization setting enables patrons or clientele to search, find, and visualize digital maps for personal use and edification. It also provides opportunities for digital scholarship by students and faculty within an academic community setting that includes the need for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing geographic data. Information organizations can also use GIS to make their metadata repositories spatially aware where metadata contains geospatial information. For example, a library catalog that contains geographic information within bibligraphic entries could utilize GIS to help patrons locate items spatially within the library. Another application of GIS is on the World Wide Web (WWW) in the form of web mapping and web mapping services. There are also vast online repositories and portals of geographic data that vary widely in their collection, description, and organization of that data. The disparity in geographic metadata quality prevents users from finding the data they need to best answer their information query. The ability to identify and evaluate GIS as a service provided by an information organization and as an online tool for exploring and connecting geographic data within the context of the WWW is a skill needed by current librarians or information scientists. Evaluating GIS as an information retrieval system within these contexts provides opportunities to determine how GIS can best meet the information needs of the 21st century user. \n\n\nINFO 244: Database Search Assignments\n\n\nIn an online searching class (INFO 244) a series of assignments were completed that gave hands-on experience querying various information retrieval systems. The assignments required searching against various databases available in ProQuest. Each assignment contained an information request from a hypothetical researcher to guide the information query and keywords. The first assignment involved performing searches for information related to health and medicine and included searches in the MEDLINE database. The information request included finding the five best results for results of clinical trials malaria vaccines tested on humans. The second assignment involved finding five citations of articles matching an information request in the aquatic sciences looking for strategies to manage the impact of climate change on freshwater lake ecosystems. These citations needed to include figures or tables as part of the article. The third assignment required finding five relevant citations of editorials or letters to the editor from American minority newspapers about Jesse Owens' participation and subsequent snubbing in the 1936 Olympics. The fourth assignment involved searching for citations by the information scientist \nMarydee Ojala\n using the Web of Science search platform. \n\n\nFor each assignment the information question had to be analyzed to understand the information need. Key terms were extracted to construct an initial boolean search query. The first query was executed and the result set was analyzed. Facets were used to help narrow the result sets down such as publishing date, subject heading, classification, and document features (i.e. tables, graphs, maps, diagrams, illustrations, and charts). The search results were analyzed and a determination was made to continue searching if the result set either was too large or didn't contain enough relevant results. Multiple queries were tried for each assignment to narrow down the search results to a manageable result set size. Bates' (1989) berrypicking-evolving search technique was used in each assignment to query and find relevant search results that answered the specified information need. These assignments gave practical experience querying information retrieval systems.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nLibrarians or information scientists learn and master the principles of information science to better meet the needs of their users. Information is of little value if it is not organized, classified, and stored for later retrieval. Information retrieval systems are a core part of information science that facilitate organizing, classifying, and storing data so that patrons and clientele of the systems can search and retrieve information they need. Coursework completed in the SJSU MLIS program demonstrates direct experience designing, querying, and evaluating information retrieval systems. \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBates, M. J. (1989).

One type of digital information that continues to increase in quantity and value is geospatial information (also referred to as spatial or geographic information). Geospatial information is information that is tied to a physical location on earth. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a collection of components designed to create, manage, store, and retrieve geospatial information. A GIS enables spatial analyses and data visualizations of the geographic data within the system. Understanding and evaluting geographic information systems makes it possible for librarians or information scientists to better meet the geographic information needs of their patrons and clientele.   GIS in an information organization setting enables patrons or clientele to search, find, and visualize digital maps for personal use and edification. It also provides opportunities for digital scholarship by students and faculty within an academic community setting that includes the need for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing geographic data. Information organizations can also use GIS to make their metadata repositories spatially aware where metadata contains geospatial information. For example, a library catalog that contains geographic information within bibligraphic entries could utilize GIS to help patrons locate items spatially within the library. Another application of GIS is on the World Wide Web (WWW) in the form of web mapping and web mapping services. There are also vast online repositories and portals of geographic data that vary widely in their collection, description, and organization of that data. The disparity in geographic metadata quality prevents users from finding the data they need to best answer their information query. The ability to identify and evaluate GIS as a service provided by an information organization and as an online tool for exploring and connecting geographic data within the context of the WWW is a skill needed by current librarians or information scientists. Evaluating GIS as an information retrieval system within these contexts provides opportunities to determine how GIS can best meet the information needs of the 21st century user.",

The assignments required searching against various databases available in ProQuest. Each assignment contained an information request from a hypothetical researcher to guide the information query and keywords. The first assignment involved performing searches for information related to health and medicine and included searches in the MEDLINE database. The information request included finding the five best results for results of clinical trials malaria vaccines tested on humans. The second assignment involved finding five citations of articles matching an information request in the aquatic sciences looking for strategies to manage the impact of climate change on freshwater lake ecosystems. These citations needed to include figures or tables as part of the article. The third assignment required finding five relevant citations of editorials or letters to the editor from American minority newspapers about Jesse Owens' participation and subsequent snubbing in the 1936 Olympics. The fourth assignment involved searching for citations by the information scientist  Marydee Ojala  using the Web of Science search platform.   For each assignment the information question had to be analyzed to understand the information need. Key terms were extracted to construct an initial boolean search query. The first query was executed and the result set was analyzed. Facets were used to help narrow the result sets down such as publishing date, subject heading, classification, and document features (i.e. tables, graphs, maps, diagrams, illustrations, and charts). The search results were analyzed and a determination was made to continue searching if the result set either was too large or didn't contain enough relevant results. Multiple queries were tried for each assignment to narrow down the search results to a manageable result set size. Bates' (1989) berrypicking-evolving search technique was used in each assignment to query and find relevant search results that answered the specified information need. These assignments gave practical experience querying information retrieval systems.",

            "text": "Competency F\n\n\nThe sixth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to \n\"use the basic concepts and principles related to the selection, evaluation, organization, and preservation of physical and digital information items\"\n. Information organizations select, evaluate, organize, and preserve physical and digital information items for a variety of reasons depending on the mission and aims of the organization. For example, an archive or special collection will select, evaluate, organize, and preserve materials with a different focus and set of priorities than a library. Archives and special collections hold materials that are unique, rare, or specialized with the intent to make the materials available in the present as well as for future students and researchers. Libraries collect and hold materials to make materials available for use by their patrons. If a library item is worn out through patron use a new copy is purchased. Archives and special collections don't always have that luxury as items in the collection may not be available for purchase and replacement. \n\n\nWith the rise of computer and network technologies there is an increase in the storage and use of digital information items. While there is an increase in the creation of digital data (either born-digital or analog items converted to digital formats) the effective selection, evaluation, organization, and preservation of this data is achieved by following fundamental concepts that are independent of the item's format. An organization's laws, policies, standards, practices, systems, technologies, management, leadership teams, staff, and clientele all work together to either support or hinder the use and handling of information items (McDonald, 2005, p. 3). Effective application of these concepts also requires knowing as much about the information items as possible including their historical context, condition, and value. There are also legal and copyright ramifications to the management of information items including how society views these information items and what is considered an authentic information item particularly in the digital world. Information item management can be represented \"as the process of managing the corporate memory in a way that makes trustworthy records readily accessible any time they are required\" (Stephens, 2005, p. 111). \n\n\nThe selection process of physical or digital items for an information organization is constrained by a variety of factors including budget, space, the organization's aims, the organization's collecting policy, collection levels, library cooperation, item availability, patron use, and reaching non-patrons. The main focus of selection is ensuring the materials meet the needs of the organization's clientele and patrons. Evaluation is about judging the inherent quality and worthiness of a material considered for inclusion in an organization (Katz, 1980, p. 89). Organizing materials so that they are \"arranged, described, and made available in a suitable reference environment\" (Cox, 1992, p. 117) is key to ensuring that the items will be utilized by the organization's clientele or patrons. Organization of materials includes cataloging and locating the items where they can be easily retrieved and used by an organization's staff and patrons. This includes creating accurate and complete metadata about the item so that both physical and digital retrieval and use are most efficient. Preservation is important in ensuring that materials are available for retrieval and use by an organization's clientele or patrons both in the present as well as into the future. Preservation includes both restoration and conservation. Restoration seeks to bring back an item as close as possible to its original condition. Conservation is concerned with protecting and treating an item so that it doesn't degrade over time and use (Cox, 1992, p. 86). Coursework and projects in the SJSU MLIS program provided opportunities to use the basic concepts and principles related to selection, evaluation, organization, and preservation of both physical and digital information items. \n\n\nEvidence\n\n\nThe following evidence from previous course work demonstrate experience in using the basic concepts and principles related to the selection, evaluation, organization, and preservation of physical and digital information items.\n\n\n\n\nAnnotated bibliography about Geographic Information Systems (GIS)\n\n\nDiscussion post about digital preservation\n\n\nINFO 280 manuscript/book projects (evaluation)\n\n\n\n\nLIBR 210: Annotated Bibliography\n\n\nThis assignment required creating an annotated bibliography. An annotated bibliography is an organized list of bibliographic entries for information items with a brief description and assessment to justify including the item in a library collection. The annotated bibliography can be used by staff of an information organization to guide their collection development decisions so that the organization better serves the needs of its patrons or clientele. \n\n\nChoosing the scope of the bibliography was the first step in the project. The scope established constraints for the bibliography that included the subject area, target audience or organization, purpose, and year published. This bibliography was limited to information items related to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) that would help reference staff in an academic library answer students' and faculty's GIS-related information needs. All items in the bibliography had to be published no later than 2009 to ensure the currency of the materials in connection with current technology trends. \n\n\nOnce the scope of the bibliography was in place the next step included finding information items related to GIS. Finding GIS-related items included performing numerous searches using web search engines, online book retailers, and various library databases and indexes. The scope of the bibliography was like a lens to help focus in on the most relevant items and help filter out items that were not as helpful. Without a clearly defined scope the bibliography's accuracy and direction would be diluted and untrustworthy, lacking focus and direction. Discovered items were selected to be included based on their evaluation against the scope and purpose of the bibliography. If an item didn't fall within the parameters of the scope then the item wasn't included in the bibliography. Part of item selection included identifying the item type, purpose, content, and subject. Gathering as much information about the item was essential to understanding the item enough to know how it compared against the bibliography's scope. This included understanding the item's cost, availability, critical reviews, format, authority and scholarly appropriateness, and ease of use. \n\n\nAfter 20 items were chosen the items were organized into categories by item type. The following three categories were created based on the items selected: 1) books, 2) online resources, and 3) scholarly journals and databases. These categories were created by looking at the material type of each item in the list. After the items were selected, evaluated, and organized they were listed on a website that included each item's bibliographic entry in APA format along with the item's description and assessment statements. The website listed items by category and provided an interface to quickly scan each category and item. This project provided first-hand experience with selection, evaluation, and organization of information items for an information organization. \n\n\nINFO 220 Discussion Post: Digital Preservation\n\n\nA discussion post in a class about Digital Humanities (DH) addressed the issue of digital preservation. DH and the digital humanist is interested in almost all of things generated by humans. We live in a time where massive quantities of data are being created and communicated daily in a variety of media, formats, and protocols. The discussion post answered the following two questions: 1) Are we facing the greatest age of loss? and 2) What are your thoughts on best practices for digital preservation moving into the future?\n\n\nIf \"age of loss\" is defined as not being able to preserve everything then the history of human society has been one long \"age of loss\". Although a seemingly noble and altruistic goal it seems virtually impossible to preserve everything. The question isn't about whether we are preserving everything or not but rather what should the preservation focus and attention be of the librarian or information scientist. With the resources of time, money, and energy that do exist what can be preserved? This seems to be a more realistic and approachable question to answer. Digital preservation is particularly challenging as digital data is easily lost and ephemeral. Digital formats and technologies rapidly change and evolve over time making it a moving target for preservationists to capture and save. Digital preservation is also very expensive as the quantity and quality of storage media increases. Preserving items in digital format doesn't reduce cost but most likely increases it. Despite the challenges the argument can be made that it is worth the effort:\n\n\n\n\n\"Data is fragile and needs to be stewarded in the 'cyberworld' just like we need to take care of rain forests and the environment in the physical world. Preserving valued data in the information age is fundamental to ensure that it will continue to inform and enrich our world for the foreseeable future\" (Library of Congress, 2016). \n\n\n\n\nComputing technologies will continue to improve and reduce in cost. What was possible technically 20 years previously has radically changed compared to the present state of digital and computing technologies. The real challenge in digital preservation isn't technical in nature but rather a challenge of resources: time, money, and personnel. \n\n\nINFO 280 Manuscript and Printed Book Projects\n\n\nFundamental to any preservation work is deeply understanding the nature of the item that is considered for preservation. Two projects provided opportunities to deeply examine and consider physical information items within a new digital context. To examine the items in detail required either gaining access to a physical copy the item or finding a high-quality digital scan. Bibliographies were also authored for both projects of sources used to examine and explain the items. \n\n\nThe first project explored a medieval codex created in the late 15th century. This codex, entitled \nDe divi Mathiae regis laudibus rebusque gestos dialogue\n, contained a dialogue on the deeds of King Matthias of Hungary. The examination of the medieval codex involved exploring the codex's background and context, physical description, and the codex's script or handwritten features. To understand the codex's background required researching the historical context surrounding the codex, its author (or authors), and the codex's origins and ownership (or provenance). The physical description included identifying the codex's size, binding, writing support material, collation, ink, rubrication and historiated initials, and decoration. Using a high quality digital scan of the codex enabled examining the codex and its pages in great detail. Examining the script included identifying the handwriting style, incipit (or an ornate introduction in the text), explicit (or the page with the final words for the work), subscriptio or colophon, and marginalia (marks made by the authors in the margins of the pages). \n\n\nThe second project explored a first edition of a printed book from the 19th century. This book, entitled \nThe Book of Mormon\n, was a religious text written by Joseph Smith, Jr. and published by E. B. Grandin in 1830. This project examined the context and content of the printed work by identifying the title on the spine and title page (if present), the author and their background, the origin story of the book, and details about the publisher, printer, and place of publication. The physical description of the item was also identified which included the item's size and format, paper, foliation and pagination, printer's device (if present), type and typeface used, color printing (if any), binding, and fly leaves. \n\n\nDeeply examining an information item's background, historical context, authorship, and physical anatomy contributes to evaluating and selecting items for physical or digital preservation. These two particular information items had already been digitally preserved by making high-quality image scans of the works. Making these scans available on the World Wide Web (WWW) enables continued scholarship to better understand these works and their value and role within our cultural heritage. These two projects were another form of digital preservation that took analog media and analyzed them using a new digital format and medium.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nLibrary and information science encompasses efforts by information professionals to \"select, preserve, and make available primary sources that document the activities of institutions, communities, and individuals\" (SAA Council, 2011). Each of these activities is shaped the by the needs of current and potential users. Coursework completed in the SJSU MLIS program provide experience with each of these core components of library and information science. Trained information professionals have a duty and responsibility to society, local communities, and patrons in applying these principles so that information items are available for current and future generations. \n\n\n\n\n\"Since ancient times, archives have afforded a fundamental power to those who control them. In a democratic society such power should benefit all members of the community. The values shared and embraced by [information professionals] enable them to meet these obligations and to provide vital services on behalf of all groups and individuals in society\" (SAA Council, 2011).\n\n\n\n\nSelecting, evaluating, organizing, and preserving information items extends the life of the item and its metadata. This in turn benefits society by preserving significant items related to cultural heritage, extending the individual, group, and institutional memory, and serving a diverse audience of scholars and interesting individuals for their personal study and life-long learning. \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCox, R.

            "text": "Competency G\n\n\nThe seventh competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to \n\"demonstrate understanding of basic principles and standards involved in organizing information such as classification and controlled vocabulary systems, cataloging systems, metadata schemas or other systems for making information accessible to a particular clientele;\n.\n\n\nThe organization and analysis of information is of great significance to society and today's information age. The information, knowledge, and wisdom that is generated within societies is of little value if not for the ability to analyze, classify, and catalog this information. Classification and controlled vocabulary systems, cataloging systems, and metadata schemas are human-created tools used to help analyze the content or subject within information items. In addition to identifying the core essence of an information item, these tools reveal a network of related terms, concepts, and ideas found within and between information items. Identifying what an information item is about and its relationships to other similar items lead to more easily and effectively retrieving an item in time of need. \n\n\nThe \nLibrary of Congress Classification (LCC)\n and \nDewey Decimal System (DDC)\n are example classification systems. These systems are used by libraries to categorize and locate library materials based on the item's subject. Items in the library are assigned a call number based on the item's subject that cooresponds to either an LCC or DDC classification. LCC is used by the United States Library of Congress as well as by many academic and research libraries. DDC is used in public and school libraries. These classification systems are standard classification systems used by information organizations to classify catalog items in the organization's collections.\n\n\nThe \nLibrary of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)\n is an example of a controlled vocabulary (or thesaurus) that is used to identify the subject of an information item in the item's metadata or bibliographic record. These subject heading terms help to categorize and classify information items by the item's major content subjects. While the LCSH is used widely as a standard controlled vocabulary for many information organizations some organizations hold collections of a more specialized nature that can't be properly addressed by the LCSH. Where the LCSH isn't appropriate an information organization may use another controlled vocabulary or thesaurus that better meets their classification needs and is more focused on their area of expertise. For example, the U.S. National Library of Medicine created their own thesaurus of medical-specific terms called the \nMedical Subject Headings (MeSH)\n. \n\n\nHuman language is variable, rich, and complex. This richness and complexity brings ambiguity and nuance that can lead to confusion and misunderstanding. Controlled vocabularies refers to a pre-defined set of terms that represent an information item's subject and content. This includes subject headings, classification systems, thesauri, or approved keywords (Lancaster, 1986, p. 3). Controlled vocabularies and classification systems are designed to remove this complexity by combining similar or related terms and contrasting between homographs (Lancaster, 1986, p. 7). They organize and structure information items for later retrieval. The lack of controlled vocabularies in classification activities and systems leads to \"wasted effort and a certain degree of searching failure\" (Cleveland & Cleveland, 1990, p. 77). The presence of these systems ensures that indexers and searchers of information items use a common set of keywords and terms to consistently and predictably categorize, search, and find information items. \n\n\nCataloging systems provide a way to organize information items and materials that leverages classification and controlled vocabulary systems. Cataloging systems include records for the information items available from the information organization. These records in the cataloging system are metadata about the information items. Metadata is data about data. It helps describe the information items available for searching and use by an information organization. The metadata records expose pre-determined access points for patrons to search against and find items that match their information needs. Example access points for a library catalog include author, title, subjects, and call number. Staff of an information organization catalog or categorize information items that the organization provides by creating metadata records that can be stored in the cataloging system. This categorization process includes using classification and controlled vocabulary systems to add structure and control that ensures items are placed in the catalog in ways that facilitates later retrieval. Patrons or clientele of an information organization perform searches using the cataloging system to find and retrieve the desired information items.\n\n\nMetadata schemas are standards adopted by information organizations for describing information items and their content. These schemas provide consistentcy and predictability for how data is described and formatted. The \nAmerican National Standards Institute (ANSI)\n and \nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO)\n are information organizations created to help develop standard metadata schemas and repositories that can be used by information organizations throughout the United States and the world. \nDublin Core\n is a standard controlled vocabulary used with metadata schemas to describe information items. This standard is adopted by many metadata schemas to allow for interoperability between metadata and cataloging systems. All of these concepts, processes, and standards impose bibliographic control over information items for the fundamental purpose of making information easily accessible. Coursework and projects in the SJSU MLIS program provided practical experience to learn the basic principles of organizing information and information items. \n\n\nEvidence\n\n\nThe following evidence from previous course work demonstrate using and understanding the basic concepts and principles related to the organization and control of information items. \n\n\n\n\nControlled vocabulary group project\n\n\nCataloging exercises and assignments\n\n\nMetadata schema projects: Finding Aid (EAD) and Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) XML\n\n\n\n\nLIBR 247 Controlled Vocabulary Group Project\n\n\nThe final project in LIBR 247 required constructing a thesaurus within a given knowledge domain. The project consisted of three group members. The first steps in the thesaurus construction process included identifying the thesaurus' target audience and narrowing the knowledge domain to something specific. The group decided to create a thesaurus within the knowledge domain of container vegetable gardening targeted to beginning, hobbyist, and urban gardeners growing vegetables in containers. This narrow focus helps to manage the scope of the terms included in the thesaurus so that term selection isn't too broad but the subject area isn't so narrow that the thesaurus lacks enough terms. \n\n\nNext, terms for the thesaurus were extracted from online and print literature within the knowledge domain and entered into a spreadsheet. The initial list was over 400 extracted terms. Terms that didn't fall within the knowledge domain, duplicate terms, or non-relevant terms mere removed from the list. The remaining terms were put into facets and the relationships between facets and terms were analyzed. Scope notes were added to terms from a variety of sources to help clarify and limit the definition of terms. \n\n\nThe final thesaurus consists of 110 preferred terms. The boundaries of the thesaurus' domain was limited to vegetables, environment, pests, diseases, beneficial insects, and plant care. These are the central subject areas used to categorize and organize all the terms. Each of these facets had their own sub-facets to further categorize and classify the terms and their relationships between each other. The final thesaurus is presented using classified and alphabetical indices for the terms. The construction of the thesaurus and its organization is designed to assist users to find the terms helpful for their research. One example organizational feature are the use and UF reference are included in the thesaurus to direct a user to the correct term. Another example organizational feature is the use of broad and narrow terms to create an appropriate hierarchy across the thesaurus. This project validates the adage that constructing a thesaurus or controlled vocabulary is an art as well as a science.\n\n\nLIBR 248 Cataloging Exercises and Assignments\n\n\nMARC is a machine-readable cataloging record stanard used by libraries and information organizations for cataloging information items. This format stores metadata about an information item including information such as author, subject, title, publishing location and copyright date. These pieces of metadata about an item are like digital signposts that indicate to a computer or user information about the information item. \n\n\nCataloging exercises and assignments in LIBR 248 provided practical experience understanding the MARC bibliographic standard. These exercises and assignments taught the field and tag numbers most frequently used by catalogers and other information professionals as well as the general MARC syntax for each field. Each assignment required cataloging books of varying genres. This experience demonstrates the challenges and nuances involved in making decisions about how to best represent the item's bibliographic metadata in MARC format. Sometimes the information item represents a piece of information (e.g. book title) in multiple ways. These differences make it more challenging to know which representation is the best for the MARC record.\n\n\nExercises and assignments also introduced concepts of authority control records. When describing an information item or creating metadata about that item there are various pieces of information that could have various forms. Names, titles, subject headings, and geographic place names are example fields that if left freeform would lack consistency and data integrity. Authority control records establish recognized and standard forms for field values. The \nLibrary of Congress Name Authority File\n and the \nLibrary of Congress Subject Headings\n are used to standardize on the content of name fields and subject heading fields. Like controlled vocabulary design and construction cataloging is as much an art as it is a science. \n\n\nLIBR 246 Metadata Schema Projects\n\n\nLike data, metadata comes in many shapes and sizes. There are many metadata formats and standards to help provide structure and organization to how data is described and organized. XML (extensible markup language) is a metalanguage that gives the ability to define a markup language used to describe data. Many metadata formats manifest themselves in documents adhering to the XML specification. \nText Encoding Initiative (TEI)\n and \nEncoded Archival Description (EAD)\n are example metadata formats (or schemas) that are used to describe information. TEI is a specification for digitally representing texts in digital form. EAD is a specification for digitally describing and encoding archival finding aids. \n\n\nTwo projects were completed offering experience with these metadata schemas. The first project consisted of creating an XML file using the TEI schema to digitally represent two handwritten letters from the 19th century. This project required understanding the basic structure and schema required for a TEI document. After creating a TEI file to represent a handwritten letter, the XML file was checked for being well-formed (the XML structure and syntax was correct) and validated against the schema used. The schema validation checks that the fields and values entered in the XML match the cooresponding metadata schema. \n\n\nThe second project created two XML files using the EAD schema to represent two finding aids.One of the finding aids needed to be transformed into a PDF (Portable Document Format) for print purposes. Another finding aid needed to be transformed into HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) format for online display and browsing by patrons. The process of transforming the EAD finding aid into other document formats required knowing the structure and standards specified in the EAD metadata schema. Both of these projects taught valuable skills working with metadata schemas. \n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nInformation's ultimate value lies in the ability to find and retrieve information in time of need. Information unorganized (or poorly organized) is difficult to find, retrieve, process, analyze, and understand. When information is organized, classified, categorized, and cataloged it becomes easier to find, retrieve, process, analyze, and understand. Bibliographic control mechanisms and tools used to organize, classify, catalog, and describe information items and resources are designed to make information more easily accessible to patrons and clientele. Coursework completed in the SJSU MLIS program gave first-hand experience designing and constructing a controlled vocabulary, working with current cataloging formats and standards, and learning the structure and standards defined in the TEI and EAD metadata schemas. This coursework illustrates the science as well as the art of organizing information resources. \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCleveland, D. B. and Cleveland, A. D.

Societies throughout the world are experiencing rapid technological advancement. What was once considered science fiction is now reality. Computing technologies from the early 20th century that filled entire rooms and required multiple wires and cables are now available in the palm of one's hand without needing to tether the device with wires or cables. The rise of new networking technologies enables a level and connectivity and information access unparalleled in earth's recorded history. \n\n\nLibrary and information scientists have played key roles in the adoption and experimentation of new technological advancements (Rubin, 2016, p. 175). To stay relevant in a world of technological change information organizations and their staff must identify, use, and evaluate these new information and communication technologies or risk become obsolete and not able to meet the information needs of their societies and communities. Information organizations and their staff are positioned to learn, adopt, and utilize these new technologies better than anyone else (Main, 2008, p. 149). New and emerging information and communication technologies include mobile computing devices, 3D printing, virtual reality (VR), blogs, wikis, RSS feeds, podcasts, instant messaging, digital photo services, software as a service and cloud computing, web and computer development languages and tools, mobile apps, social media, vlogs, and mash ups (Main, 2008, p. 149-158; Rubin, 2016, p. 175-227). \n\n\nIdentifying, using, and evaluating current and new technologies is part of one's information literacy. Identifying current and new technologies requires searching internet portals, repositories, websites, blogs, and app stores for tools and technologies that have application within an information organization. It also includes describing and understanding a given digital tool. This could include asking the following questions:\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the tool's main purpose and function? \n\n\nWhat are the tool's main features? \n\n\nWho is the intended audience for the tool? \n\n\nWhat computing platforms does the tool work with? \n\n\nIs it a desktop, mobile, or web-based tool? \n\n\nIs the tool a commercial product or free or \nopen source\n? \n\n\nDoes the tool work with proprietary or standard data formats?\n\n\nWhat is the current version of the tool?\n\n\nIs the tool actively being updated and worked on?\n\n\n\n\nLearning to use these technologies so that their value can be evaluated requires a basic level of tool literacy to explore a technology and its ecosystem. Reading technical documentation and following online tutorials is also part of using current and new technologies. Evaluating a current or new technology involves assessing whether the technology and its capabilities matches the needs of the information organization and its clientele or patrons. Just because a technology is new or available doesn't necessarily mean an information organization must shift their focus and attention to that technology. Decisions to adopt a new technology need to be made deliberately with the focus on better serving the information organization's staff and patrons. Coursework and projects in the SJSU MLIS program provided to demonstrate proficiency in working with new and emerging information and communication technologies. \n\n\nEvidence\n\n\nThe following evidence from previous course work demonstrates proficiency identifying, using, and evaluating current and emerging technologies. \n\n\n\n\nProjects using web technologies\n\n\nLIBR 210 reference tool analysis\n\n\nINFO 220 Digital Humanities tools analysis\n\n\n\n\nProjects Using Web Technologies\n\n\n\n\nLIBR 210 Annotated Bibliography\n\n\nLIBR 210 Library Reference Guide\n\n\nLIBR 210 Instructional Screencast: Web Mapping\n\n\nLIBR 246 Final Project: Custom XML Schema\n\n\n\n\nThe SJSU MLIS program offered opportunities to learn, evaluate, and utilize web-based technologies to complete projects. The four projects listed above are examples where web-based technologies were identified, evaluated, and used to complete the project. \n\n\nA class from the SJSU MLIS program (LIBR 246) offered training and experience building websites from scratch using web technologies including HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and Javascript. The \nannotated bibliography\n and \nlibrary reference guide\n for a reference services course (LIBR 210) both allowed freedom in the medium chosen to present the content. These two projects were constructed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as the web-based code repository hosting service \nGitHub\n. \nGitHub\n is a website offering hosting of Git repositories. \nGit\n is an open source version control system (VCS). The website was hosted using \nGitHub Pages\n, a feature offered through GitHub. The HTML, CSS, Javascript, and image files needed to develop these two project websites were stored in a repository on GitHub. Storing the files for the projects in Git using GitHub allowed for managing the coding and development changes as the project sites were built. Changes committed to the Git repository for the website were stored and available to see what changes were made to the repository's source code files. The Git repository also allowed for changes to be reverted if a change didn't work correctly or wasn't displaying properly in the website. The process of using HTML, CSS, javascript, and Github to create two projects helped evaluate the potential of these technologies highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of these technologies.\n\n\nAn instructional screencast for a reference services course (LIBR 210) demonstrated how to create a basic web map using web technologies. The screencast explored the definition of a web map, showed a few example web maps, and explained how they are created. The screencast involved utilizing the web-mapping service \nMapbox\n. The screencast shows step-by-step how to sign up for a Mapbox account and create a simple web map using a \npre-created list of locations to map\n. The screencast also includes introductions to other technologies such as \ngeocoding\n, \ncsv\n, and plain text file formats. Creating this screencast required identifying, using, and evaluating these technologies to ensure that the information presented could easily be followed and understood by others wanting to use these technologies. \n\n\nThe final project in an XML (Extensible Markup Language) technology class (LIBR 246) identified and used XML-based technologies. This required learning fundamental XML concepts including schema files, XML validation, and XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) and HTML. The project also provided an opportunity to learn and use the XML text editor \nOxygen\n. These technologies and tools were used together to create a XML representation of a personal music collection. The XML representation could be transformed into different views of the data in HTML format. Information organizations and staff work with XML formatted data in many different contexts and settings. This final project provided experience learning and using these technologies that are still widely used throughout library and information science today. \n\n\nLIBR 210 Reference Tool Analysis: Goodreads\n\n\nSocial media tools have and are continuing to transform how individuals and groups interact within society. These tools also impact how information organizations and their staff interact with patrons and clientele. A discussion post for LIBR 210 required looking at how social media is being used in a library. The \nSalt Lake County Library System\n uses the social media service \nGoodreads\n. The discussion post evaluates this technology tool by identifying the social media service Goodreads, showing how the Salt Lake Country Library System is using Goodreads, and discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the social media service.  \n\n\nGoodreads allows an individual to create a Goodreads user profile where they can track the books they have read, are reading, and want to read. Books can be rated using a star-rating system. Users can share their reading information with other users of the site. The service also provides a community feature to create groups that can act like book clubs or discussion forums about books of interest. The Salt Lake County Library System uses Goodreads to promote their libraries and services while also helping to create an engaged library patron community who love books. The library system has a Goodreads account that they use to showcase library staffs' favorite books. They also have a Goodreads group that is open to the public to join. This group is used for anyone part of the group to discuss their favorite books and conduct polls that encourage participation in the group. The group is also used to communicate library events, library services, reading programs, monthly reading challenges, new library materials, author visits, clubs, or other library-specific activities of interest to the local community.\n\n\nA strength of the library system's use of this service is in how they utilize the group community features of Goodreads. By using the Goodreads group for library marketing, outreach, and promotion and the creating an online commons for patrons to interact in non-threatening ways the Salt Lake County Library System creates a useful resource to strengthen the library community. Two weaknesses of this social media tool are 1) its lack of integration with the Salt Lake County Library System's circulation services and library catalog and 2) the inability to distinguish users of Goodreads as Salt Lake County Library System patrons from non-library community patrons or knowing if Goodreads users represent a majority of the library system's patrons. Patrons of the library system using Goodreads can't guarantee that items they find in Goodreads are available in the county libraries without leaving Goodreads and searching for the item in the library system's online catalog. Despite these weaknesses Goodreads seems to be a useful social media tool to encourage and promote a love for libraries as well as build a devoted community of library patrons. \n\n\nINFO 220 Tools Analysis\n\n\nDigital humanities (DH) is an academic field concerned with the intersection of digital technologies and tools with traditional humanities and liberal arts disciplines of study. DH concerns itself with studying the impact of digital and computing technologies on humanity and humanities research as well as using digital tools and technologies to do humanities research and analysis (Fitzpatrick, 2012, p. 13-14). An assignment from a course on DH (INFO 220) required identifying and evaluating three DH tools. There are many online library guides and portals that list tools applicable for use in DH research. Example guides include \nCaroline Digital Humanities Initiative (CDHI)\n, \nDigital Methods Initiative (DMI) Tools\n, \nTAPoR\n, and \nDiRT (Digital Research Tools)\n.\n\n\nDiRT\n organizes their list of tools based on the type of research work. This assignment identified and evaluated one tool for each of the following three categories:\n\n\n\n\nArchiving Tools\n\n\nNetwork Analysis\n\n\nMapping\n\n\n\n\nDocument Image Viewer with AJAX (Diva.js)\n is an open source tool to help information organizations display documents and scanned materials from archives or collections in a user-friendly interface. This free tool is a JavaScript library meaning that its a package of code written in the \nJavaScript programming language\n that web developers can use to quickly develop an application or a portion of an application without needing to write the code from scratch. Diva.js enables an organization to plug into their website a user-friendly document viewer that is interoperable with the \nInternational Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)\n allowing access to high-quality images that are part of the IIIF community. Documentation on the tool's main website targets end-users of the interface. The source code repository includes documentation for web developers familiar with writing JavaScript code. The library is not easy (or intended) for a non-programmer to install and implement. But once it is installed and connected to an institution's digitized materials it presents those materials in a user-friendly interface that is easy to use and navigate and that integrates well with existing library and information organization systems.\n\n\nGephi\n is an open source computer application that explores and visualizes data that can be modeled using networks and relationships. The tool runs on a desktop or laptop computer (Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux) as opposed to running as a web application, website, or mobile device (i.e. smartphone or tablet). Networks and relationships can be modeling using nodes and links. Nodes are entities in the network that share relationships. Links are the relationships between nodes. Data structured in standard data formats that follow this node-link paradigm can be imported into this application. Once data is imported into the application various network-related analyses can be performed (e.g. link analysis, social network analysis, and biological network analysis). These and other quantitative analyses help measure the characteristics of the network and relationships. The strengths of this tool lie in its ability to work with standard data formats, running on the three major computing platforms, and the exhaustive pre-built set of analyses and metrics that can help understand the nature of networks and network relationships. The tool's weaknesses lie in the steep learning curve and almost impenetrable jargon and network analysis algorithms that are not intended for a general audience or novice. Example uses of this tool could include analyzing relationships between characters in a literary work, exploring monetary transactions using transaction ledgers from an past civilization, and visualizing the connectedness of people on popular social media networks. \n\n\nLeaflet\n is an open source JavaScript library for creating interactive, user-friendly web maps. The programming library can be used across multiple computing platforms and was designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use. Many private and public organizations use Leaflet to create web maps showing data and areas of interest specific to their patrons or clientele. This tool enables interactive mapping features that are common for today's web maps: panning by dragging the map, zooming with a mouse scroll wheel, pinch and zoom on mobile devices and trackpads, keyboard navigation, layer switching, and marker dragging. Web maps created with Leaflet are easily customizable including the ability to display custom information tied to map features. The tool is intended for web developers. The tool's documentation is thorough and includes helpful tutorials for getting started quickly that a beginning or novice developer could use. There are many possible ways of using this tool for DH research. Almost all research in the humanities involves some kind of location that could be mapped to a physical space on earth. Historical events and places, photographs, literary locations and place names, and transcribed texts with place name information are example applications for this tool.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nDigital and computing technologies are in a state of constant churn and flux. New tools, techniques, and technologies continue to rise and fall. With an increase in the number of technologies and tools it becomes increasingly hard to know what is available and what is worth one's time and effort. To sift through the deluge of technologies and tools and find what is available and know what is worth one's time and effort requires the ability to curate technologies; to identify, use, and evaluate current and emerging technologies. Coursework and projects in the SJSU MLIS program provided training and experiences to learn this art of technology curation. The future of digital technology can be fuzzy and hard to see. But one thing is certain: \"LIS professionals will need to be flexible and open-minded about [technology] transformations\" for with new technologies comes the opportunity to \"demonstrate the centrality of the library in the lives of those they serve\" (Rubin, 2016, p. 226-227). \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFitzpatrick, K.

            "text": "The eighth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to  \"demonstrate proficiency in identifying, using, and evaluating current and emerging information and communication technologies\" . Societies throughout the world are experiencing rapid technological advancement. What was once considered science fiction is now reality. Computing technologies from the early 20th century that filled entire rooms and required multiple wires and cables are now available in the palm of one's hand without needing to tether the device with wires or cables. The rise of new networking technologies enables a level and connectivity and information access unparalleled in earth's recorded history.   Library and information scientists have played key roles in the adoption and experimentation of new technological advancements (Rubin, 2016, p. 175). To stay relevant in a world of technological change information organizations and their staff must identify, use, and evaluate these new information and communication technologies or risk become obsolete and not able to meet the information needs of their societies and communities. Information organizations and their staff are positioned to learn, adopt, and utilize these new technologies better than anyone else (Main, 2008, p. 149). New and emerging information and communication technologies include mobile computing devices, 3D printing, virtual reality (VR), blogs, wikis, RSS feeds, podcasts, instant messaging, digital photo services, software as a service and cloud computing, web and computer development languages and tools, mobile apps, social media, vlogs, and mash ups (Main, 2008, p. 149-158; Rubin, 2016, p. 175-227).   Identifying, using, and evaluating current and new technologies is part of one's information literacy. Identifying current and new technologies requires searching internet portals, repositories, websites, blogs, and app stores for tools and technologies that have application within an information organization. It also includes describing and understanding a given digital tool. This could include asking the following questions:   What is the tool's main purpose and function?   What are the tool's main features?   Who is the intended audience for the tool?   What computing platforms does the tool work with?   Is it a desktop, mobile, or web-based tool?   Is the tool a commercial product or free or  open source ?   Does the tool work with proprietary or standard data formats?  What is the current version of the tool?  Is the tool actively being updated and worked on?   Learning to use these technologies so that their value can be evaluated requires a basic level of tool literacy to explore a technology and its ecosystem. Reading technical documentation and following online tutorials is also part of using current and new technologies. Evaluating a current or new technology involves assessing whether the technology and its capabilities matches the needs of the information organization and its clientele or patrons. Just because a technology is new or available doesn't necessarily mean an information organization must shift their focus and attention to that technology. Decisions to adopt a new technology need to be made deliberately with the focus on better serving the information organization's staff and patrons. Coursework and projects in the SJSU MLIS program provided to demonstrate proficiency in working with new and emerging information and communication technologies.",

The four projects listed above are examples where web-based technologies were identified, evaluated, and used to complete the project.   A class from the SJSU MLIS program (LIBR 246) offered training and experience building websites from scratch using web technologies including HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and Javascript. The  annotated bibliography  and  library reference guide  for a reference services course (LIBR 210) both allowed freedom in the medium chosen to present the content. These two projects were constructed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as the web-based code repository hosting service  GitHub .  GitHub  is a website offering hosting of Git repositories.  Git  is an open source version control system (VCS). The website was hosted using  GitHub Pages , a feature offered through GitHub. The HTML, CSS, Javascript, and image files needed to develop these two project websites were stored in a repository on GitHub. Storing the files for the projects in Git using GitHub allowed for managing the coding and development changes as the project sites were built. Changes committed to the Git repository for the website were stored and available to see what changes were made to the repository's source code files. The Git repository also allowed for changes to be reverted if a change didn't work correctly or wasn't displaying properly in the website. The process of using HTML, CSS, javascript, and Github to create two projects helped evaluate the potential of these technologies highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of these technologies.  An instructional screencast for a reference services course (LIBR 210) demonstrated how to create a basic web map using web technologies. The screencast explored the definition of a web map, showed a few example web maps, and explained how they are created. The screencast involved utilizing the web-mapping service  Mapbox . The screencast shows step-by-step how to sign up for a Mapbox account and create a simple web map using a  pre-created list of locations to map . The screencast also includes introductions to other technologies such as  geocoding ,  csv , and plain text file formats. Creating this screencast required identifying, using, and evaluating these technologies to ensure that the information presented could easily be followed and understood by others wanting to use these technologies.   The final project in an XML (Extensible Markup Language) technology class (LIBR 246) identified and used XML-based technologies. This required learning fundamental XML concepts including schema files, XML validation, and XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) and HTML. The project also provided an opportunity to learn and use the XML text editor  Oxygen . These technologies and tools were used together to create a XML representation of a personal music collection. The XML representation could be transformed into different views of the data in HTML format. Information organizations and staff work with XML formatted data in many different contexts and settings.

            "text": "Competency I\n\n\nThe ninth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to \n\"use service concepts, principles, and techniques to connect individuals or groups with accurate, relevant, and appropriate information\"\n.\n\n\nInformation organizations haven't always been service oriented (Tyckoson, 2008, p. 128). Historically information organizations have focused on building collections and preserving materials in those collections. Patrons of those organizations were predominately a relatively small class of elites within society. The majority of people within society were denied access to these information organizations and their collections due to a variety of factors including economic status and low literacy rates. There was an overall low general demand for personal access to reading materials. Since the late 19th century information organizations and their staff have shifted towards a more service-oriented approach as literacy and education rates increased helping to raise demand for access to reading materials. \n\n\nThe first meeting of the American Library Association addressed the need for information organizations to provide better reference services for patrons. It was stated in the conference that \"[p]ersonal intercourse and relations between librarian and readers are useful in all libraries\" (Green, 1876, p. 79). Librarians should attend to the needs of patrons like shop-keepers, inn-keepers, and store clerks strive to serve their customers (Green, 1876, p. 79-80). This establishes the core model for information organizations and their staff to connect individuals and groups with accurate, relevant, and appropriate information: 1) Patrons come to the organization seeking answers to their inquiries and 2) the organization staff interact with the patrons to help them find answers to their questions. Effectively connecting individuals and groups with information requires seeing the patron and their information requests as opportunities for service rather than an \"irritation at being interrupted\" (Finks, 1991, p. 353). Thus, the value of an information organization, librarian, or information scientist lies in their ability to help clientele and patrons search, find, and discover information they need. \n\n\nLibrarians or information scientists answer questions and information requests for a wide variety of items and topics that they may know little about. The skills of the librarian or information scientist lie in their ability to process information requests regardless of their personal knowledge of the matter. They rely upon their knowledge of domain classifications, reference resources, search and information retrieval to know where the answer can be found to help meet the information needs of the patron (Green, 1876, p. 77). They are aware of ethical considerations and policies that govern how they interact with patrons and clientele in an honest and open way that respects the rights and privacy of the patron as well as the information organization and its materials. They promote and support freedom of information and the free access of information to improve and better oneself. They are flexible, amenable, and creative thinkers who react quickly and nimbly in their interactions with the organization's clientele or staff. They are life-long learners that continually seek to progress in their understanding and knowledge of principles, subject areas, concepts, and tools that enable them to effectively answer the information requests of clientele or patrons.\n\n\nEvidence\n\n\nCoursework completed in the SJSU MLIS program demonstrated how to connect clientele or patrons to accurate, relevant, and appropriate information.  \n\n\n\n\nLibrary reference transactions\n\n\nLibrary reference resources mini activities\n\n\nServing underserved populations discussion response\n\n\n\n\nLIBR 210 Library Reference Transactions\n\n\nLibrary reference transactions are direct ways librarians or information scientists connect individuals or groups with accurate, relevant, and appropriate information. The \nALA RUSA (Reference and User Services Association) Guidelines\n identifies and recommends \"observable behavioral attributes that could be correlated with positive patron perceptions of reference librarian performance\" (RUSA, 2013). Aspects of a reference interview to watch include visibility and approachability, interest, listening and inquiring, searching, and following-up. The success of the patron being connected to the information they need in a positive, uplifting way depends upon the approach the librarian takes to the reference interview. A course on reference librarianship provided four opportunities to interact with a librarian using different modes of communication to observe the application of the RUSA guidelines:\n\n\n\n\nFace-to-face Library Reference Transaction\n\n\nPhone Call Library Reference Transaction\n\n\nEmail Library Reference Transaction\n\n\nOnline Chat Library Reference Transaction\n\n\n\n\nInteracting with the reference librarian and asking a question using these different communication modes provided a way to see how the behavior of the librarian influenced how well they were able to connect the patron to the correct information. \n\n\nThe face-to-face interview was a little lacking in the librarian's interest and approachability. Although they answer the information request a lack of engagement resulted in a feeling of uncertainty that they provided all the information they could towards helping answer the question. A reference interview over the phone showed the challenge presented with phone reference interviews. Relying solely upon audio queues and signals makes it more difficult for the librarian to gauge whether they are connecting the patron to information that meets their information needs. A phone call to a local public library lacked the appropriate inquiry and follow-up from the librarian to make sure that the original information need was fully answered. Reference interview interactions with librarians over email and online chat highlighted the ability of electronic resources and websites to assist in connecting patrons to the information they need. Electronic interfaces (e.g. websites and mobile applications) can either be stumbling blocks or stepping stones to helping patrons or clientele receive relevant, accurate, and appropriate information to match their information needs. Finding how to initiate a reference interview using email or online chat was simple and straightforward because the academic library's website interface was designed clearly and effectively. Despite the ease in finding and initiating the reference interview the answers given over these modes felt incomplete and lacked complete satisfaction in answering the original information requests. Because human communication can be imperfect and ambiguous at times there is an inherent need to listen carefully, ask good questions, and follow-up to make sure the questions were answered in a satisfying way. This seems particularly true of communication modes where the librarian and patron are in separate physical locations. There is a need of more reliance on listening, inquiring, and following-up with non-in-person reference interviews to ensure that the patron feels satisfied with the reference answers. \n\n\nLIBR 210 Reference Resources Mini Activities\n\n\nSuccessfully connecting individuals or groups with accurate, relevant, and appropriate information presupposes that the librarian or information scientist knows where the information resources are located. Knowing as many of these information resources improves the ability and success in connecting individuals and groups with information that meets their needs. A series of assignments (called mini activities) provided experience using information resources across a variety of knowledge domains and disciplines: \n\n\n\n\nGenealogical Reference Resources\n\n\nSearch Engines and Search Strategies\n\n\nDictionaries, Encyclopedias, Etc. \n\n\nFinding Facts\n\n\nLaw, Health, and Business Sources\n\n\nE-resources on \"transformational leadership\"\n\n\nBiographical Information, Government Publications, and Web 2.0\n\n\nReader\u2019s Advisory and Sources, Children and Young Adults, and Science\n\n\n\n\nThese mini activities introduce information resources that can be used to help answer future patrons or clientele reference queries. Each mini activity includes specific information questions that could only be answerd by hands-on use of various databases, tools, techniques, and resources. Some of the mini activity exercises required reflecting on the process taken to find an answer to the information query. Being aware of the process and path one takes to find answers to information questions helps embed these resources in the minds of the librarian or information science for later retrieval in time of need. Just like a water well without water is of no value to the thirsty traveler, a librarian or information scientist lacking information resources and answers is of little value to the inquiring patron. Knowing the information resources available for a variety of knowledge domains prepares the librarian or information scientist to connect patrons and clientele to accurate, relevant, and appropriate information.\n\n\nLIBR 210 Discussion Post: Serving Underserved Populations\n\n\nA key to connecting accurate, relevant, and appropriate information to individuals and groups is knowing and understanding the needs of individuals and groups asking for information. A discussion post about serving underserved populations demonstrates the need for empathy and understanding of individuals and groups seeking information. This posting also demonstrates how important it is for information professionals to provide accurate, relevant, and appropriate information in formats that individuals and groups can utilize. This discussion post considers the minority population of the visually impaired. Visual impairment is a major obstacle to connecting to information that meets an information need. To effectively connect a visually impaired individual requires training and experience with assistive hardware and software tools and formats that the visually impaired can access and use. Accessibility, or the ability to access something, needs to be considered for all populations served by an information organization. This includes providing multiple ways to connect with physical materials and media (e.g. braile texts, audio transcriptions, book readers, etc.). Digital content on computers and websites need to be designed with accessibility at the core of the design rather than an afterthought that is tacked on once a product or resource's release. This discussion post demonstrates that connecting individuals and groups to accurate, relevant, and appropriate information is fundamentally an accessibility issue. Information professionals need to remember that \"technology [can] become an equalizer for the blind\" (Valenza, 2000, p. 34). \n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nRangnathan's (1964) seminal treatise on library science lists five laws that information organizations should follow to support all reference service efforts: 1) information items are for use, 2) find everyone their information item, 3) reach out and promote information items to find their owner or patron, 4) save time for the patron, and 5) an information organization is a living organism with chances for growth and decay. These five laws along with principles enumerated in Green's (1876) ALA conference address clarify the core principles and concepts of reference services. The information organization is an \"instrument of universal education\". Reference services are the spirit of the information organization (Rangnathan, 1964, 354). The reference service interaction is an opportunity where information professionals connect accurate, relevant, and appropriate information with the specific information needs of individuals and groups. Learning information and reference resources helps information professionals stay trained and informed about accurate and relevant information given the information need and knowledge domain. Having this training and knowledge allows them to meet the information needs of individuals and groups. To give relevant and appropriate information to individuals and groups requires understanding the needs of the individuals and groups. Helping individuals and groups connect to information that meets their needs is a process that engenders greater understanding and empathy between information sharer and receiver.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFinks, L.

            "text": "The ninth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to  \"use service concepts, principles, and techniques to connect individuals or groups with accurate, relevant, and appropriate information\" .  Information organizations haven't always been service oriented (Tyckoson, 2008, p. 128). Historically information organizations have focused on building collections and preserving materials in those collections. Patrons of those organizations were predominately a relatively small class of elites within society. The majority of people within society were denied access to these information organizations and their collections due to a variety of factors including economic status and low literacy rates. There was an overall low general demand for personal access to reading materials. Since the late 19th century information organizations and their staff have shifted towards a more service-oriented approach as literacy and education rates increased helping to raise demand for access to reading materials.   The first meeting of the American Library Association addressed the need for information organizations to provide better reference services for patrons. It was stated in the conference that \"[p]ersonal intercourse and relations between librarian and readers are useful in all libraries\" (Green, 1876, p. 79). Librarians should attend to the needs of patrons like shop-keepers, inn-keepers, and store clerks strive to serve their customers (Green, 1876, p. 79-80). This establishes the core model for information organizations and their staff to connect individuals and groups with accurate, relevant, and appropriate information: 1) Patrons come to the organization seeking answers to their inquiries and 2) the organization staff interact with the patrons to help them find answers to their questions. Effectively connecting individuals and groups with information requires seeing the patron and their information requests as opportunities for service rather than an \"irritation at being interrupted\" (Finks, 1991, p. 353). Thus, the value of an information organization, librarian, or information scientist lies in their ability to help clientele and patrons search, find, and discover information they need.   Librarians or information scientists answer questions and information requests for a wide variety of items and topics that they may know little about. The skills of the librarian or information scientist lie in their ability to process information requests regardless of their personal knowledge of the matter. They rely upon their knowledge of domain classifications, reference resources, search and information retrieval to know where the answer can be found to help meet the information needs of the patron (Green, 1876, p. 77). They are aware of ethical considerations and policies that govern how they interact with patrons and clientele in an honest and open way that respects the rights and privacy of the patron as well as the information organization and its materials. They promote and support freedom of information and the free access of information to improve and better oneself. They are flexible, amenable, and creative thinkers who react quickly and nimbly in their interactions with the organization's clientele or staff. They are life-long learners that continually seek to progress in their understanding and knowledge of principles, subject areas, concepts, and tools that enable them to effectively answer the information requests of clientele or patrons.",

            "text": "Library reference transactions are direct ways librarians or information scientists connect individuals or groups with accurate, relevant, and appropriate information. The  ALA RUSA (Reference and User Services Association) Guidelines  identifies and recommends \"observable behavioral attributes that could be correlated with positive patron perceptions of reference librarian performance\" (RUSA, 2013). Aspects of a reference interview to watch include visibility and approachability, interest, listening and inquiring, searching, and following-up. The success of the patron being connected to the information they need in a positive, uplifting way depends upon the approach the librarian takes to the reference interview. A course on reference librarianship provided four opportunities to interact with a librarian using different modes of communication to observe the application of the RUSA guidelines:   Face-to-face Library Reference Transaction  Phone Call Library Reference Transaction  Email Library Reference Transaction  Online Chat Library Reference Transaction   Interacting with the reference librarian and asking a question using these different communication modes provided a way to see how the behavior of the librarian influenced how well they were able to connect the patron to the correct information.   The face-to-face interview was a little lacking in the librarian's interest and approachability. Although they answer the information request a lack of engagement resulted in a feeling of uncertainty that they provided all the information they could towards helping answer the question. A reference interview over the phone showed the challenge presented with phone reference interviews. Relying solely upon audio queues and signals makes it more difficult for the librarian to gauge whether they are connecting the patron to information that meets their information needs. A phone call to a local public library lacked the appropriate inquiry and follow-up from the librarian to make sure that the original information need was fully answered. Reference interview interactions with librarians over email and online chat highlighted the ability of electronic resources and websites to assist in connecting patrons to the information they need. Electronic interfaces (e.g. websites and mobile applications) can either be stumbling blocks or stepping stones to helping patrons or clientele receive relevant, accurate, and appropriate information to match their information needs. Finding how to initiate a reference interview using email or online chat was simple and straightforward because the academic library's website interface was designed clearly and effectively. Despite the ease in finding and initiating the reference interview the answers given over these modes felt incomplete and lacked complete satisfaction in answering the original information requests. Because human communication can be imperfect and ambiguous at times there is an inherent need to listen carefully, ask good questions, and follow-up to make sure the questions were answered in a satisfying way. This seems particularly true of communication modes where the librarian and patron are in separate physical locations. There is a need of more reliance on listening, inquiring, and following-up with non-in-person reference interviews to ensure that the patron feels satisfied with the reference answers.",

Knowing as many of these information resources improves the ability and success in connecting individuals and groups with information that meets their needs. A series of assignments (called mini activities) provided experience using information resources across a variety of knowledge domains and disciplines:    Genealogical Reference Resources  Search Engines and Search Strategies  Dictionaries, Encyclopedias, Etc.

Each mini activity includes specific information questions that could only be answerd by hands-on use of various databases, tools, techniques, and resources. Some of the mini activity exercises required reflecting on the process taken to find an answer to the information query. Being aware of the process and path one takes to find answers to information questions helps embed these resources in the minds of the librarian or information science for later retrieval in time of need. Just like a water well without water is of no value to the thirsty traveler, a librarian or information scientist lacking information resources and answers is of little value to the inquiring patron. Knowing the information resources available for a variety of knowledge domains prepares the librarian or information scientist to connect patrons and clientele to accurate, relevant, and appropriate information.",

            "text": "Competency J\n\n\nThe tenth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to \n\"describe the fundamental concepts of information-seeking behaviors\"\n. Information seeking and information behavior are terms referring to human behavior that is so fundamental and commonplace that it can easily go unnoticed. These terms refer to the \"common human cycle of needing, looking for, choosing, and using information of some kind\" (Case, 2008, p. 35). Assessing an individual's information need and helping individuals meet those needs is part of the role of a librarian or information scientist. \n\n\nInformation seeking behaviors begin with the information user or patron and their information need (Wilson, 1981). The patron recognizes that their knowledge and understanding about a subject is inadequate to achieve some result or goal. They tend to seek out informal reference sources more often than formal sources and will be satisfied with the first appropriate solution to their query rather than trying to find the best answer. Quality is often sacrificed for expediency and convenience (Rubin, 2016, p. 378; Case, 2008, p. 37-38). The information needs of individuals vary across these strata and occur within specific contexts both internal (e.g. memories, thoughts, motivations, and personality) and external (e.g. profession, family, and friends). The information seeking process is organic and can change between information queries as well as during the information seeking process. It \"is rarely a simple, linear process that comes to complete fruition\" (Case, 2008, p. 40). \n\n\nInformation seeking behaviors are studied from a variety of perspectives including employment, role within society, and demographics (Rubin, 2016, p. 373). Many researchers have identified various ways to model information seeking. One study represented the information seeking process as six stages: initiation, selection, exploration, formulation, collection, and presentation (Kuhlthau, 1991, p. 367). Other models attempt to describe the relationship between communication, information seeking, information behavior, and information searching (Wilson, 1999). The rise of computer and internet technologies have made a major impact on individuals' information seeking behaviors. The World Wide Web (WWW) provides access to massive amounts of information and creates new ways of information searching and seeking. The WWW's chaotic and changing nature add complexity to the information seeking process. Seeking and searching for information on the WWW is a fluid, dynamic process where individuals use multiple search techniques within various contexts to find answers to their information queries.\n\n\nEvidence\n\n\nThe following coursework completed within the SJSU MLIS program demonstrates an understanding of the concepts of information seeking behaviors. \n\n\n\n\nDiscussion post about meeting user information needs\n\n\nEssay on information seeking behaviors\n\n\nEAD Finding Aids search project\n\n\n\n\nLIBR 200 Discussion Post: Meeting Patron Information Needs\n\n\nA discussion post asks whether a librarian should serve the needs of the patrons rather than the patrons' wants. Put in other words: Should a librarian be popular or right? The discussion post answer states that being right would be preferred to being popular. A patron may not recognize for themselves their exact information need. \"Merely answering a patron\u2019s question might not be enough; the individual might want a particular piece of information, only to discover that something different is needed\" (Rubin, 2010, p. 275). Finding information is not usually the problem. With more electronic information resources available to more people the quantity of information is not an issue. The issue is in the quality of the data in answering the information need. \"For most of the situations [librarians and information scientists] face there is not a problem getting enough information but rather with interpreting and understanding what information we already have\" (Case, 2008, 40). This is the role that the information professional plays in understanding the information seeking behaviors of their patrons. If the information professional understands the information seeking behaviors of their patrons they will be able to provide more effective service in meeting their needs. They are positioned to help filter and guide patrons and clientele to sources of information that meet their information needs and in this process show patrons how they can find answers for themselves. \n\n\nLIBR 202 Essay: Information Seeking Behaviors\n\n\nFamily history research is the study of families by identifying family lineage and history. An essay for an information retrieval course (LIBR 202) analyzed the information seeking behaviors of family history researchers (FHRs). FHRs conduct research within both professional and amateur contexts. They have unique motivations and interests for the information they seek. The information seeking behavior of FHRs is a long term, lifelong approach \"carried out sporadically yet intensively\" (Darby & Clough, 2013, p. 75). FHR is conducted over an eclectic range of information resources and resource types that can reveal names, birth and death locations and dates, marriage location and date, stories, and photographs about their ancestors. The focus of FHRs is on names first, geographic locations second, and lastly dates Darby & Clough, 2013, p. 74). Information sharing among peers is another unique aspect of FHRs that leads to a strengthened personal understanding of information seeking tools and techniques, advancement of personal FHR and the advancement of peers' FHR. This essay demonstrates that not all user groups and individuals follow the same information seeking behaviors. The information seeking behavior of individuals and groups can be closely connected to the context and setting for the information being sought.\n\n\nINFO 244 Final Project: EAD Finding Aids and Search\n\n\n\n\nOnline video of the presentation\n\n\nPresentation slides and notes\n\n\n\n\nTo help researchers and library patrons as well as ensure the long-term preservation of archival holdings and collections, archivists create detailed descriptions of items and collections in their archives. These detailed descriptions are called finding aids. The finding aid is used by archivists as well as patrons to know what is in an archive and where to find the materials in the archive\u2019s collection (Duff & Stoyanova, 1998, p. 44). The finding aid has been encoded in various formats throughout its history. The Encoded Archival Description (EAD) is a digital encoding format for finding aids in an online environment (The Library of Congress, 2012).\n\n\nA final project in a course about online searching (INFO 244) provided an opportunity to apply principles of information seeking behaviors to the use of EAD finding aids. The project was an online presentation including slides and notes that explored the role of search and online EAD finding aids. Patrons and clientele of archives and special collections rely on finding aids to meet their information needs and complete their research. This project showed that the combination of EAD finding aids on the World Wide Web aligned well with Bates' berrypicking search technique (Bates, 1989). The display and search interfaces for these finding aids vary widely and lack consistency. Poorly designed search interfaces act as a barrier to successfully searching for information in finding aids. Keyword searching was an information seeking behavior that found the greatest success as compared to subject-based searches against finding aids. \n\n\nThe project findings recommended that search interfaces should be aligned with Bates' (1989) model of search strategies providing a broader range of access points to the finding aid. Finding aid search interfaces should allow for a variety of access points including subjects, names, dates, and geographic locations. The project also concluded that a focus on the design of the search interface ignores understanding user information seeking behaviors. Better understanding the information seeking behaviors of archival finding aid users will lead to improving search and search interfaces for EAD finding aids. \n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nWith an increase in the quantity of information items and sources it becomes increasingly challenging to navigate the deluge of information available in society to find answers to one's information needs. Librarians and information scientists have sought to understand how patrons and clientele seek information by creating models that explain their information seeking behaviors. Some models of information seeking behavior explain the causes for how one seeks as opposed to the process they take in searching (J\u00e4rvelin and Wilson, 2003). Information seeking behaviors by individuals and groups are dynamic and commonly utilize multiple strategies and models to find information (Xie, 2012). There are a wide variety of models explaining individuals' and groups' information seeking behaviors. Because of the organic nature of search and information seeking behavior there may not be a universal approach to explain all aspects and issues in the information seeking process (Xie, 2012). In order to meet the needs of their patrons and clientele (and reinforce the value and significance of their information organization) librarians and information scientists must shift to become \"truly user-oriented, innovative, [and] experimental\" to fully understand and match the needs of their patrons and clientele (Wilson, 1981, p. 668). Coursework and projects completed in the SJSU MLIS program provided training and experience to better understand information seeking behavior for the purpose of better meeting the needs of others.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBates, M.

If the information professional understands the information seeking behaviors of their patrons they will be able to provide more effective service in meeting their needs. They are positioned to help filter and guide patrons and clientele to sources of information that meet their information needs and in this process show patrons how they can find answers for themselves.",

An essay for an information retrieval course (LIBR 202) analyzed the information seeking behaviors of family history researchers (FHRs). FHRs conduct research within both professional and amateur contexts. They have unique motivations and interests for the information they seek. The information seeking behavior of FHRs is a long term, lifelong approach \"carried out sporadically yet intensively\" (Darby & Clough, 2013, p. 75). FHR is conducted over an eclectic range of information resources and resource types that can reveal names, birth and death locations and dates, marriage location and date, stories, and photographs about their ancestors. The focus of FHRs is on names first, geographic locations second, and lastly dates Darby & Clough, 2013, p. 74). Information sharing among peers is another unique aspect of FHRs that leads to a strengthened personal understanding of information seeking tools and techniques, advancement of personal FHR and the advancement of peers' FHR. This essay demonstrates that not all user groups and individuals follow the same information seeking behaviors. The information seeking behavior of individuals and groups can be closely connected to the context and setting for the information being sought.",

            "text": "Online video of the presentation  Presentation slides and notes   To help researchers and library patrons as well as ensure the long-term preservation of archival holdings and collections, archivists create detailed descriptions of items and collections in their archives. These detailed descriptions are called finding aids. The finding aid is used by archivists as well as patrons to know what is in an archive and where to find the materials in the archive\u2019s collection (Duff & Stoyanova, 1998, p. 44). The finding aid has been encoded in various formats throughout its history. The Encoded Archival Description (EAD) is a digital encoding format for finding aids in an online environment (The Library of Congress, 2012).  A final project in a course about online searching (INFO 244) provided an opportunity to apply principles of information seeking behaviors to the use of EAD finding aids. The project was an online presentation including slides and notes that explored the role of search and online EAD finding aids. Patrons and clientele of archives and special collections rely on finding aids to meet their information needs and complete their research. This project showed that the combination of EAD finding aids on the World Wide Web aligned well with Bates' berrypicking search technique (Bates, 1989). The display and search interfaces for these finding aids vary widely and lack consistency. Poorly designed search interfaces act as a barrier to successfully searching for information in finding aids. Keyword searching was an information seeking behavior that found the greatest success as compared to subject-based searches against finding aids.   The project findings recommended that search interfaces should be aligned with Bates' (1989) model of search strategies providing a broader range of access points to the finding aid. Finding aid search interfaces should allow for a variety of access points including subjects, names, dates, and geographic locations. The project also concluded that a focus on the design of the search interface ignores understanding user information seeking behaviors. Better understanding the information seeking behaviors of archival finding aid users will lead to improving search and search interfaces for EAD finding aids.",

            "text": "With an increase in the quantity of information items and sources it becomes increasingly challenging to navigate the deluge of information available in society to find answers to one's information needs. Librarians and information scientists have sought to understand how patrons and clientele seek information by creating models that explain their information seeking behaviors. Some models of information seeking behavior explain the causes for how one seeks as opposed to the process they take in searching (J\u00e4rvelin and Wilson, 2003). Information seeking behaviors by individuals and groups are dynamic and commonly utilize multiple strategies and models to find information (Xie, 2012). There are a wide variety of models explaining individuals' and groups' information seeking behaviors. Because of the organic nature of search and information seeking behavior there may not be a universal approach to explain all aspects and issues in the information seeking process (Xie, 2012). In order to meet the needs of their patrons and clientele (and reinforce the value and significance of their information organization) librarians and information scientists must shift to become \"truly user-oriented, innovative, [and] experimental\" to fully understand and match the needs of their patrons and clientele (Wilson, 1981, p. 668). Coursework and projects completed in the SJSU MLIS program provided training and experience to better understand information seeking behavior for the purpose of better meeting the needs of others.",

            "text": "Competency K\n\n\nThe eleventh competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to \n\"design instructional programs based on learning principles and theories\"\n.\n\n\nThe proliferation of information in today's society is reaching levels never seen previously in recorded history. This rising tide of information coupled with advancements in computing and internet technologies is transforming the way learning and instruction are conducted. Attempting to teach the breadth and depth of human knowledge becomes a futile effort. The goal of teaching and instruction must be to help learners learn how to learn so that they are motivated to become life-long learners. \n\n\nInstruction and learning within the context of libraries and information organizations has its roots in the end of the 19th century when Dewey (1876) stated that 'the librarian is in the highest sense a teacher\" (p. 6). Librarians are challenged to develop instructional tools and programs for patrons that represent a wide range of various \"capabilities, needs, and preferences for assistance\". Approaches to teaching within a library context have taken a trial-and-error approach to see what teaching methods best meet the needs of learners (McNeer, 1991, p. 295-296). While this approach can produce successful learning and teaching experiences there is a more sure way for instructors to more directly meet the needs of students and learners. Understanding how learners think and the theories surrounding learning and instruction will impact instructional efforts of an information organization to better meet the needs of its learners (McNeer, 1991, p. 294).\n\n\nMany theories exist that help explain how knowledge is gained. A classical learning theory that tries to answer how an individual learns something new comes from Plato, the ancient Greek philosopher. He proposed the theory that knowledge is innate, coming with an individual at birth. Teaching is the process of helping one remember what they already know. Another classical theory of learning comes from the British philosopher John Locke. He proposed the theory that the individual is a blank slate at birth but has the mental capacity to process the experiences it gains combining simple ideas together to form more complex ideas. This theory manifests itself to prerequisites for learning (Phillips and Soltis, 1998, p. 15). Learning complex ideas requires first learning and experience more basic concepts. Without experience with the basic, simple ideas the individual will not be able to formulate and understand more complex ideas. Both of these theories treat learning as a passive process. \n\n\nBehaviorists of the 19th century saw learning as the process of acquiring new behavior that is shaped by one's environment and setting. New theories of learning grew from John Dewey and the Gestalt psychologists that saw the learning process as a more active one based on what the learner did rather than what the teacher taught. New insights and learning come from interacting and engaging with material that is of interest to the learner. Constructivism proposed another view of knowledge and learning that grew from the psychologist Jean Piaget in the early 20th century. This viewpoint saw learning as the formulation of cognitive structures. New information is assimilated into preexisting knowledge frameworks or accommodated by adjusting one's knowledge framework based on experience. This theory proposed that learners grow in stages and emphasized the need of active learning experiences. \n\n\nThese theories emphasize the truth that there are different kinds of learning and different kinds of learners. Learning theories shape and direct the teaching methods and strategies one takes with learners. Methods of learning and teaching can be organized into five major categories (Walsh, 2011, p. 10):\n\n\n\n\nTraditional instruction\n\n\nActive learning\n\n\nComputer-assisted instruction\n\n\nLearner-centered instruction\n\n\nSelf-directed independent learning\n\n\n\n\nThe traditional instruction method places the instructor as the speaker and lecturer. This traditional, lecture method of instruction is an outcome-based approach. The teacher presents previously prepared material that matches a given set of concepts that the students should learn. The material is organized in a way that can be presented orally and visually. The materials is presented in a classroom or auditorium setting. Students passively received the material as communication is one-way in this approach. Assessing whether the instruction has met the needs of the learners is challenging with this approach.\n\n\nThe active learning method stems from the Socratic Method where Socrates, a classical Greek philosopher, would interact with his students asking them questions and encouraging active participation in the learning process. This type of instruction and learning involves action on the part of the student. The objective of this approach is to ignite the learning of a learner from within; to motivate their own desire for learning through asking questions and seeking answers to those questions. This method is easier to assess and better meets the needs of learners with different learning styles. \n\n\nComputer-assisted instruction is made possible by advancements in computer and networking technologies. This method utilizes computers and the World Wide Web (WWW) to present tutorials and learning materials in a way that engages the student through interactive activities to achieve previously planned learning objectives. Lessons and tutorials can be accomplished at the learners' pace and is typically accomplished in an individual setting as opposed to a group or classroom setting. \n\n\nLearner-centered instruction places learners at the center of attention and focus rather than the instructor or lecturer. Learners aren't just actively engaged in learning but in instruction and teaching. Learners are empowered more to seek out knowledge themselves rather than rely on a teacher. Learning occurs within a classroom or group environment. Lessons are designed by the instructor to facilitate learner engagement to learn how to learn and find answers themselves. The instructor or teacher takes on a facilitator or moderator role to guide learners in ways that enable the learner to become self-sufficient. \n\n\nSelf-directed independent learning relies upon the learner taking full initiative for their own education. They determine the activities and materials they want to pursue including assessing their progress in the learning process. Activities are given to the student in a variety of ways that encourages the learner to go beyond the minimal material presented. Learning can take place in a variety of asynchronous or synchronous settings. \n\n\nResearch progress in the study of the mind has created a \"cognitive revolution\" giving new insights to how individuals learn and understand (Simon, 2000, p. 116). \"[T]he meaning of \"knowing\" has shifted from being able to remember and repeat information to being able to find and use it\" (National Research Council, 2000). Instruction and learning must elevate to become more active and involved that creates deep understanding and experience. Efforts to increase the amount of asynchronous instruction and learning in the classroom (including the flipped classroom approach) are examples of striving to elevate the effectiveness of instruction and learning. Example-based teaching, creating learning environments where discovery and exploration is fostered, and helping learners visualize new concepts and ideas are other examples of new approaches to instruction and learning in today's information age. The push towards more active, engaging learning that is hypersensitive to the information and learning needs and abilities of learners flows out of the learning theories developed by philosophers and psychologists. Coursework in the SJSU MLIS program provided opportunities for designing instructional resources based on these learning principles and theories. \n\n\nEvidence\n\n\nThe following projects and assignments demonstrate examples of designing instructional programs based on learning principles and theories. \n\n\n\n\nInstructional screencast for creating a web map\n\n\nInstructional screencast for using a library database\n\n\nDiscussion post about flipped classrooms\n\n\nLibrary guide about web mapping\n\n\n\n\nLIBR 210 Instructional Screencast: How to Create a Web Map\n\n\nWeb mapping is an emerging technology on the World Wide Web (WWW) that is a useful tool for information professionals to learn and use. Web mapping is the merging of cartography and the WWW. Most web maps are interactive in nature allowing the user to pan, zoom, and click on the map. While first introduced to the WWW through services like MapQuest and Google Maps, web mapping is available for both the WWW user and creator. There are a variety of web mapping tools that make it easy for anyone with a beginning level of computer experience to create web maps. Information professionals work with a wide variety of data and information. Much of this data has some spatial or geographic location component to it. Web mapping makes it possible to map geographic data on the WWW. \n\n\nA screencast was developed to help information professionals be more aware of this emerging technology and provide a tutorial that can be followed to create their own web map. The screencast is an engaging way to introduce web mapping to a wider audience that may not be as familiar with cartography and mapping. It leads the viewer along in an incremental way that starts with identifying web maps. The content of the screencast was intentionally positioned for a librarian or information professional with beginning computer skills to complete. This user audience shaped what content was included, the way it was presented, and the terminology and jargon used to present it. Examples of existing web maps and web mapping technologies are initially shown to help orient the user to the subject matter. The main focus of the screencast is to lead the viewer through the steps they need to take to make their own web map. The screencast begins by showing a finished version of the web map so the viewer has a frame of reference and vision of what can come from following along in the screencast. The screencast was scripted in a way that would make it easy for the viewer to have success if they followed along. The audio and video of the screencast are synced together so that what the viewer sees matches what is being discussed. \n\n\nUsing an online video as the mechanism for delivering the instruction has the downside of lacking a good support mechanism for answering questions and follow-up. The screencast places more burden on the viewer to stay motivated in following along with the video to create their own web map. An advantage of the asynchronous online video instruction is the flexibility of the viewer to consume the material at their own pace. The video can be re-watched multiple times as well as pausing and starting to capture details as desired. This video was made using \nVimeo\n and allows the video to be embedded into different websites. This flexibility would allow a librarian to embed the video in a library guide or on the organization's intranet. The length of the screencast was kept under 12 minutes intentionally to not intimidate viewers and to help assure that creating a web map doesn't need to take a large amount of time. Sample map data that the viewer needs to create the map shown in the screencast is available for download using a link in the video description. Effort was made to show each step of the process so that the viewer wouldn't feel lost or disoriented while viewing. \n\n\nThis screencast was developed based on the active learning, computer-aided instruction, and the self-directed methods of instruction. These methods are rooted in constructivist learning theories that emphasize offering learners activities and experiences to build and construct their own knowledge framework. This approach relies on the initiative of the learner to engage with the material and gain their own insights as they work through the tutorial presented in the screencast.  \n\n\nLIBR 210 Instructional Screencast: IEEE Xplore Library Database Training\n\n\nLibrary research databases vary widely in their interfaces and implementations. Vendors follow their own styles and approaches to creating search, browse, and viewing interfaces for accessing content in a database. Because of this variety it can be confusing for a patron to know how to use a particular database interface. A screencast was developed to help explain how to use the \nIEEE Xplore Digital Library\n to undergraduate engineering students in fields such as electrical, computer, bioengineering, and geoscience.  \n\n\nThis video was made using \nVimeo\n and allows the video to be embedded into different websites. This flexibility would allow a librarian or professor to embed the video in a library guide, course blog, or website. A link to the IEEE Xplore Digital Library was included in the video description. The screencast begins by showing the viewer the main website and explaining the database content and intended audience. Then the screencast shows how undergraduates can access the database using the university library's website. After explaining how to get to the database the screencast demonstrates how to perform a basic, advanced, and command line search using the database. Then the screencast demonstrates two hypothetical search situations that relate to the intended audience.  \n\n\nThe screencast was scripted in a way that would make it easy for the viewer to have success if they followed along. The audio and video of the screencast are synced together so that what the viewer sees matches what is being discussed. The length of the screencast was limited to under 10 minutes to be a more consumable length for a busy college student. Delivering this material using an online video allowed the viewer flexibility in consuming the content at their own pace. The screencast provides an introduction to using the database and hopefully sparks students into exploring the database more as well as reaching out to a subject librarian if they have questions not answered by the video. \n\n\nThis instructional screencast follows the active learning, computer-aided instruction, and self-directed instructional methods. Objectives of the screencast included giving the viewer their own experiences working with the library database interface trusting that the viewer's understanding and motivations in using the interface would grow with more experience and hands-on learning. \n\n\nLIBR 210 Discussion Post: Flipped Classrooms\n\n\nPedagogical methods and techniques evolve and develop as computer and networking technologies progress. The emergence of the internet and the WWW in the late 20th century enabled new forms of instruction and learning. Some of these forms are simply digital versions of presently held methodologies and approaches. The flipped classroom is a new form of teaching and instruction that is made easier with digital and computing technologies. \n\n\nThe traditional instruction-learning model included students coming to class and interacting with the professor in a synchronous session. The instructor presents a prepared lecture introducing and explaining specific concepts that the students need to learn. To help reinforce these concepts the instructor assigns reading or exercises to complete on the student's own time by a specific deadline. The student would take the assignment home to work on asynchronously. The assignment would then be turned back into the instructor who would then grade the work showing the student how well they understood the material. \n\n\nThe flipped classroom reverses this approach. Using multi-media content the instructor assigns lecture materials for the students to review on their own time away from the classroom (asynchronously). When the students come to class they have already consumed the lecture material and are given time in class (synchronous) to ask questions and work on exercises and problems to help re-enforce the materials. In its purest form the flipped classroom switches where the lectures and assigned homework are accomplished. By allowing the students to work on assignments in the classroom they can ask questions and get immediate feedback from the instructor to know how well they are understanding the material.\n\n\nA discussion post addresses the strengths and weaknesess of this pedagogical approach. Strengths of this approach include being able to consume and review lecture material at ones own pace. The time spent in the classroom becomes more valuable for the students motivating them to attend class as much as possible. This method also has the potential for increasing the level of engagement from the students and helping them apply what they learn in a classroom environment with the direct support and supervision of the instructor. Weaknesses of this approach include ignoring how students learn. Some students learn better with the traditional approach while others may prefer the flipped classroom approach. Another downside is that the flipped classroom demands more self-initiated work from the students and the instructor. This can be challenging for those who need mentoring and guidance to initiate the learning process. The amount of preparation for instructors to prepare lecture material in a way that students can consume out of the classroom may also be a challenge. Aspects of both the flipped and traditional classroom approaches are used in the SJSU MLIS program. This discussion post provided an opportunity to learn more about this new pedagogical method.\n\n\nLIBR 210: Web Mapping Library Guide\n\n\nA library guide (also referred to as pathfinder, subject guide, research guide, or study guide) is a kind of bibliography used as an entryway for a researcher into a particular subject area. The guide provides a path or map to direct the focus of a researcher towards major concepts, subject headings, and resources that they can use to explore more about the given topic as it pertains to their research queries. Researchers using the guide are introduced to the subject area and shown key sources for the given domain. The major concepts, subjects headings, and resources are curated by an information professional with expertise in the subject area. The materials are presented in a user-friendly format that is inviting and easy for the researcher to use. While traditionally printed, the WWW enables the publishing of library guides online in hyperlinked formats. \n\n\nA project in a reference services course (LIBR 210) involved creating an online library guide about the subject of web mapping. Web mapping is an emerging technology on the WWW that provides new and interesting ways to visualize geographic data to a wider audience. The intended audience for this library guide is academic faculty and students in the field of geography and cartography. The library guide helps faculty and students in geography-related degrees learn more about web mapping as well as find resources to help them create their own web maps for academic research and learning. \n\n\nThe library guide was constructed using \nHTML (HyperText Markup Language)\n and \nCSS (Cascading Style Sheets)\n from scratch and hosted using \nGithub Pages\n. Using these technologies provided opportunities to explore how to create a user-friendly library guide using standard web development technologies. By creating the guide from scratch it allowed full control over the presentation and style of the guide. A table of contents is present on the left-side of every page in the guide that presents major topics covered in the guide in a hierarchical format. The guide is structured into five main pages: \n\n\n\n\nWhat is web mapping?\n\n\nHow are web maps used?\n\n\nHow do I make a web map?\n\n\nAdditional resources\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\nThese five main pages are designed to cover the basic questions a researcher would ask in learning about web mapping and how they can utilize it in their research. The visual hierarchy of content on each page is designed to be easy-to-read and easy-to-scan. The guide also includes an example web map embedded in-line with the guide as an illustrative example of the possibilities of web maps. Content, style, and design decisions made during the construction of the guide aligned with the guide's purpose and intended audience: create a user-friendly online library guide about web mapping for academic geography students and faculty.\n\n\nThis library guide is shaped by the active learning teaching method that has roots in constructivist learning theory. By creating a hyperlinked library guide the learner is forced to interact with the guide clicking and navigating the content and its structure. This hands-on experience with the material is designed to give them experiences with the material where they can explore and discover new insights for themselves.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nJust as traditional modes of instruction and learning are adapting and changing the approach information organizations take towards instruction and learning must also adapt and change. One scholar noted that \"[a]s faculty and students increasingly use the Web for teaching, research, and scholarly communication, the library\u2019s traditional patterns of service delivery, including bibliographic instruction (BI), are called into question\" (Ladner, Beagle, Steele, & Steele, 2004, p. 329). Computer and networking technologies create new possibilities and applications of teaching methods and techniques. Technology enables the creation of new kinds of instructional aids and tools that have the potential to reach and engage with learners in more meaningful ways. Theories and principles of learning create a foundation that all teaching methods are built upon. Coursework and projects completed in the SJSU MLIS program offered opportunities to create and design instructional programs based on learning principles that meet the needs of patrons. With this new understanding and new technologies there is an increased need to use assessment more fully to ensure that instruction and learning matches the needs and preparation of today's learners (LaGuardia, 2012, p. 603).\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nDewey, M.

New theories of learning grew from John Dewey and the Gestalt psychologists that saw the learning process as a more active one based on what the learner did rather than what the teacher taught. New insights and learning come from interacting and engaging with material that is of interest to the learner. Constructivism proposed another view of knowledge and learning that grew from the psychologist Jean Piaget in the early 20th century. This viewpoint saw learning as the formulation of cognitive structures. New information is assimilated into preexisting knowledge frameworks or accommodated by adjusting one's knowledge framework based on experience. This theory proposed that learners grow in stages and emphasized the need of active learning experiences.   These theories emphasize the truth that there are different kinds of learning and different kinds of learners. Learning theories shape and direct the teaching methods and strategies one takes with learners. Methods of learning and teaching can be organized into five major categories (Walsh, 2011, p. 10):   Traditional instruction  Active learning  Computer-assisted instruction  Learner-centered instruction  Self-directed independent learning   The traditional instruction method places the instructor as the speaker and lecturer. This traditional, lecture method of instruction is an outcome-based approach. The teacher presents previously prepared material that matches a given set of concepts that the students should learn. The material is organized in a way that can be presented orally and visually. The materials is presented in a classroom or auditorium setting. Students passively received the material as communication is one-way in this approach. Assessing whether the instruction has met the needs of the learners is challenging with this approach.  The active learning method stems from the Socratic Method where Socrates, a classical Greek philosopher, would interact with his students asking them questions and encouraging active participation in the learning process. This type of instruction and learning involves action on the part of the student. The objective of this approach is to ignite the learning of a learner from within; to motivate their own desire for learning through asking questions and seeking answers to those questions. This method is easier to assess and better meets the needs of learners with different learning styles.   Computer-assisted instruction is made possible by advancements in computer and networking technologies. This method utilizes computers and the World Wide Web (WWW) to present tutorials and learning materials in a way that engages the student through interactive activities to achieve previously planned learning objectives. Lessons and tutorials can be accomplished at the learners' pace and is typically accomplished in an individual setting as opposed to a group or classroom setting.   Learner-centered instruction places learners at the center of attention and focus rather than the instructor or lecturer. Learners aren't just actively engaged in learning but in instruction and teaching. Learners are empowered more to seek out knowledge themselves rather than rely on a teacher. Learning occurs within a classroom or group environment. Lessons are designed by the instructor to facilitate learner engagement to learn how to learn and find answers themselves. The instructor or teacher takes on a facilitator or moderator role to guide learners in ways that enable the learner to become self-sufficient.   Self-directed independent learning relies upon the learner taking full initiative for their own education. They determine the activities and materials they want to pursue including assessing their progress in the learning process. Activities are given to the student in a variety of ways that encourages the learner to go beyond the minimal material presented. Learning can take place in a variety of asynchronous or synchronous settings.   Research progress in the study of the mind has created a \"cognitive revolution\" giving new insights to how individuals learn and understand (Simon, 2000, p. 116). \"[T]he meaning of \"knowing\" has shifted from being able to remember and repeat information to being able to find and use it\" (National Research Council, 2000). Instruction and learning must elevate to become more active and involved that creates deep understanding and experience. Efforts to increase the amount of asynchronous instruction and learning in the classroom (including the flipped classroom approach) are examples of striving to elevate the effectiveness of instruction and learning. Example-based teaching, creating learning environments where discovery and exploration is fostered, and helping learners visualize new concepts and ideas are other examples of new approaches to instruction and learning in today's information age. The push towards more active, engaging learning that is hypersensitive to the information and learning needs and abilities of learners flows out of the learning theories developed by philosophers and psychologists. Coursework in the SJSU MLIS program provided opportunities for designing instructional resources based on these learning principles and theories.",

            "text": "Web mapping is an emerging technology on the World Wide Web (WWW) that is a useful tool for information professionals to learn and use. Web mapping is the merging of cartography and the WWW. Most web maps are interactive in nature allowing the user to pan, zoom, and click on the map. While first introduced to the WWW through services like MapQuest and Google Maps, web mapping is available for both the WWW user and creator. There are a variety of web mapping tools that make it easy for anyone with a beginning level of computer experience to create web maps. Information professionals work with a wide variety of data and information. Much of this data has some spatial or geographic location component to it. Web mapping makes it possible to map geographic data on the WWW.   A screencast was developed to help information professionals be more aware of this emerging technology and provide a tutorial that can be followed to create their own web map. The screencast is an engaging way to introduce web mapping to a wider audience that may not be as familiar with cartography and mapping. It leads the viewer along in an incremental way that starts with identifying web maps. The content of the screencast was intentionally positioned for a librarian or information professional with beginning computer skills to complete. This user audience shaped what content was included, the way it was presented, and the terminology and jargon used to present it. Examples of existing web maps and web mapping technologies are initially shown to help orient the user to the subject matter. The main focus of the screencast is to lead the viewer through the steps they need to take to make their own web map. The screencast begins by showing a finished version of the web map so the viewer has a frame of reference and vision of what can come from following along in the screencast. The screencast was scripted in a way that would make it easy for the viewer to have success if they followed along. The audio and video of the screencast are synced together so that what the viewer sees matches what is being discussed.   Using an online video as the mechanism for delivering the instruction has the downside of lacking a good support mechanism for answering questions and follow-up. The screencast places more burden on the viewer to stay motivated in following along with the video to create their own web map. An advantage of the asynchronous online video instruction is the flexibility of the viewer to consume the material at their own pace. The video can be re-watched multiple times as well as pausing and starting to capture details as desired. This video was made using  Vimeo  and allows the video to be embedded into different websites. This flexibility would allow a librarian to embed the video in a library guide or on the organization's intranet. The length of the screencast was kept under 12 minutes intentionally to not intimidate viewers and to help assure that creating a web map doesn't need to take a large amount of time. Sample map data that the viewer needs to create the map shown in the screencast is available for download using a link in the video description. Effort was made to show each step of the process so that the viewer wouldn't feel lost or disoriented while viewing.   This screencast was developed based on the active learning, computer-aided instruction, and the self-directed methods of instruction. These methods are rooted in constructivist learning theories that emphasize offering learners activities and experiences to build and construct their own knowledge framework. This approach relies on the initiative of the learner to engage with the material and gain their own insights as they work through the tutorial presented in the screencast.",

Vendors follow their own styles and approaches to creating search, browse, and viewing interfaces for accessing content in a database. Because of this variety it can be confusing for a patron to know how to use a particular database interface. A screencast was developed to help explain how to use the  IEEE Xplore Digital Library  to undergraduate engineering students in fields such as electrical, computer, bioengineering, and geoscience.    This video was made using  Vimeo  and allows the video to be embedded into different websites. This flexibility would allow a librarian or professor to embed the video in a library guide, course blog, or website. A link to the IEEE Xplore Digital Library was included in the video description. The screencast begins by showing the viewer the main website and explaining the database content and intended audience. Then the screencast shows how undergraduates can access the database using the university library's website. After explaining how to get to the database the screencast demonstrates how to perform a basic, advanced, and command line search using the database. Then the screencast demonstrates two hypothetical search situations that relate to the intended audience.    The screencast was scripted in a way that would make it easy for the viewer to have success if they followed along. The audio and video of the screencast are synced together so that what the viewer sees matches what is being discussed. The length of the screencast was limited to under 10 minutes to be a more consumable length for a busy college student. Delivering this material using an online video allowed the viewer flexibility in consuming the content at their own pace. The screencast provides an introduction to using the database and hopefully sparks students into exploring the database more as well as reaching out to a subject librarian if they have questions not answered by the video.   This instructional screencast follows the active learning, computer-aided instruction, and self-directed instructional methods. Objectives of the screencast included giving the viewer their own experiences working with the library database interface trusting that the viewer's understanding and motivations in using the interface would grow with more experience and hands-on learning.",

            "text": "Pedagogical methods and techniques evolve and develop as computer and networking technologies progress. The emergence of the internet and the WWW in the late 20th century enabled new forms of instruction and learning. Some of these forms are simply digital versions of presently held methodologies and approaches. The flipped classroom is a new form of teaching and instruction that is made easier with digital and computing technologies.   The traditional instruction-learning model included students coming to class and interacting with the professor in a synchronous session. The instructor presents a prepared lecture introducing and explaining specific concepts that the students need to learn. To help reinforce these concepts the instructor assigns reading or exercises to complete on the student's own time by a specific deadline. The student would take the assignment home to work on asynchronously. The assignment would then be turned back into the instructor who would then grade the work showing the student how well they understood the material.   The flipped classroom reverses this approach. Using multi-media content the instructor assigns lecture materials for the students to review on their own time away from the classroom (asynchronously). When the students come to class they have already consumed the lecture material and are given time in class (synchronous) to ask questions and work on exercises and problems to help re-enforce the materials. In its purest form the flipped classroom switches where the lectures and assigned homework are accomplished. By allowing the students to work on assignments in the classroom they can ask questions and get immediate feedback from the instructor to know how well they are understanding the material.  A discussion post addresses the strengths and weaknesess of this pedagogical approach. Strengths of this approach include being able to consume and review lecture material at ones own pace. The time spent in the classroom becomes more valuable for the students motivating them to attend class as much as possible. This method also has the potential for increasing the level of engagement from the students and helping them apply what they learn in a classroom environment with the direct support and supervision of the instructor. Weaknesses of this approach include ignoring how students learn. Some students learn better with the traditional approach while others may prefer the flipped classroom approach. Another downside is that the flipped classroom demands more self-initiated work from the students and the instructor. This can be challenging for those who need mentoring and guidance to initiate the learning process. The amount of preparation for instructors to prepare lecture material in a way that students can consume out of the classroom may also be a challenge. Aspects of both the flipped and traditional classroom approaches are used in the SJSU MLIS program. This discussion post provided an opportunity to learn more about this new pedagogical method.",

            "text": "A library guide (also referred to as pathfinder, subject guide, research guide, or study guide) is a kind of bibliography used as an entryway for a researcher into a particular subject area. The guide provides a path or map to direct the focus of a researcher towards major concepts, subject headings, and resources that they can use to explore more about the given topic as it pertains to their research queries. Researchers using the guide are introduced to the subject area and shown key sources for the given domain. The major concepts, subjects headings, and resources are curated by an information professional with expertise in the subject area. The materials are presented in a user-friendly format that is inviting and easy for the researcher to use. While traditionally printed, the WWW enables the publishing of library guides online in hyperlinked formats.   A project in a reference services course (LIBR 210) involved creating an online library guide about the subject of web mapping. Web mapping is an emerging technology on the WWW that provides new and interesting ways to visualize geographic data to a wider audience. The intended audience for this library guide is academic faculty and students in the field of geography and cartography. The library guide helps faculty and students in geography-related degrees learn more about web mapping as well as find resources to help them create their own web maps for academic research and learning.   The library guide was constructed using  HTML (HyperText Markup Language)  and  CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)  from scratch and hosted using  Github Pages . Using these technologies provided opportunities to explore how to create a user-friendly library guide using standard web development technologies. By creating the guide from scratch it allowed full control over the presentation and style of the guide. A table of contents is present on the left-side of every page in the guide that presents major topics covered in the guide in a hierarchical format. The guide is structured into five main pages:    What is web mapping?  How are web maps used?  How do I make a web map?  Additional resources  About   These five main pages are designed to cover the basic questions a researcher would ask in learning about web mapping and how they can utilize it in their research. The visual hierarchy of content on each page is designed to be easy-to-read and easy-to-scan. The guide also includes an example web map embedded in-line with the guide as an illustrative example of the possibilities of web maps. Content, style, and design decisions made during the construction of the guide aligned with the guide's purpose and intended audience: create a user-friendly online library guide about web mapping for academic geography students and faculty.  This library guide is shaped by the active learning teaching method that has roots in constructivist learning theory. By creating a hyperlinked library guide the learner is forced to interact with the guide clicking and navigating the content and its structure. This hands-on experience with the material is designed to give them experiences with the material where they can explore and discover new insights for themselves.",

Theories and principles of learning create a foundation that all teaching methods are built upon. Coursework and projects completed in the SJSU MLIS program offered opportunities to create and design instructional programs based on learning principles that meet the needs of patrons. With this new understanding and new technologies there is an increased need to use assessment more fully to ensure that instruction and learning matches the needs and preparation of today's learners (LaGuardia, 2012, p. 603).",

            "text": "Competency L\n\n\nThe twelfth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to \n\"demonstrate understanding of quantitative and qualitative research methods, the ability to design a research project, and the ability to evaluate and synthesize research literature\"\n.\n\n\nResearch is a rigorous, systematic process that examines and studies information to expand or apply human knowledge. Research has been classified into two main methods: basic and applied (National Science Foundation, 1953, p. 38). Basic research is \"concerned with creating new, generalizable knowledge\" while applied research is \"concerned with the solving of specific problems in real situations\" (Powell, 2008, p. 169). One type is focused on creating new theories and knowledge that can be broadly applied. The other is focused on discovering applications of the general theories and knowledge. Basic and applied research can be better understood by comparing research to trees: basic research is the broad trunk of the tree while applied research is the leaves at the tips of the branches (Brady, 2015). This implies that these two methods are seen as a continuum or spectrum. Research can fall somewhere between the two types of research rather than a binary categorization. Both types of research can feed into the other. Basic and applied research can also be either quantitative or qualitative in nature or some combination of the two. A quantitative approach means that the research is measurable using numerical means. A qualitative approach means that the research is focused on characteristics, qualities, events, and behaviors of the subject (or subjects) involved in the research.\n\n\nWhile ideas for research questions and projects can come from various sources a common source comes from critical evaluation and synthesis of existing research literature. Using the results of research projects is limited if a librarian or information scientist lacks the ability to critically evaluate existing research projects (Powell, 2008, p. 177). Once a research topic and methodology are chosen the next step is designing a project that will help answer the original research questions. This will include determining the best method for capturing data that will help answer the research question. Research methods and techniques used to gather data include surveys, experiments, history and historical primary sources, case studies, focus groups, content analyses, bibliometrics, ethnography, grounded theory, phenomenology, hermeneutics, reflexivity, and discourse analysis. After data is collected that helps answer the original research question the data is analyzed. Data analysis includes organizing, summarizing, and generalizing the collected data to help identify patterns and draw conclusions. After the data is analyzed and summarized the researcher reports the research project's findings in some form of a report that can be communicated to individuals or groups with an interest in the results. Coursework completed in the SJSU MLIS program provided experience with these research concepts and processes. \n\n\nEvidence\n\n\nThe following coursework demonstrates an understanding of quantiative and qualitative research methods, the ability to design a research project, and the ability to evaluate and synthesize research literature.\n\n\n\n\nINFO 285 Literature Review\n\n\nINFO 285 Research methods critique\n\n\nINFO 285 Research Project Proposal\n\n\n\n\nINFO 285 Literature Review\n\n\nA literature review is the product of evaluating and synthesizing published information about a given subject area. By definition it is a secondary source. It doesn't add any new ideas but summarizes and synthesizes existing research and literature on a given subject. The organization and presentation of the literature review can vary but is centered around a particular research topic. The selected topic is used to search for sources related to the research topic. The literature review can be organized chronologically, methodologically, or thematically. The choice of organizational method depends upon the type and purpose of the literature review. A well constructed literature review explains why the review is being conducted. The body of the review can identify general trends, conflicts, gaps of research, or new perspectives in the related field.  \n\n\nTo prepare for writing a research project proposal a library research methods course (INFO 285) required writing a literature review. Successfully writing this literature review required clearly defining the research question. The research question for this literature review is to evaluate and assess whether the electronic finding aid interface for the L. Tom Perry Special Collections in the Harold B. Lee Library (HBLL) at Brigham Young University (BYU) is meeting the needs of its patrons. The literature review explored this study question by looking at literature related to the display of electronic archival finding aids. Basic characteristics of all the sources was enumerated including how many years the research spanned, the methodologies taken by the research, and the statistical approaches of any research projects in the literature. After this introduction to the literature major themes are discussed that were discovered while evaluating each source. These themes included user groups, display elements, navigation and search, and content standards. After discussing these themes the conclusion highlights disagreement and gaps in the literature that present opportunities for further research and study. This assignment is evidence of learning how to evaluate and synthesize research literature. \n\n\nINFO 285: Research Methods Critique\n\n\nNot all research studies are of equal value. The ability to critically evaluate a research study is a key part of understanding and applying principles and practices that will positively contribute to a given research domain (Boswell and Cannon, 2009, p. 292). As part of a larger effort in a library research methods course (INFO 285) a critique of an existing research study was written that related to a research project proposal. The research topic was about assessing the interface and display of electronic archival finding aids. The critique focused on the published results of a usability study aimed to assess the display of electronic archival finding aids at the Southern Historical Collection (Chapman, 2010). The rubric for critically assessing this study comes from criteria identified by Boswell and Cannon (2009). The critique examined the research study's report form, purpose, literature review, research questions, methodology, and results. The critique of the published research study reveals Chapman's assumptions, definitions, strengths, and limitations. \n\n\nComparing the research study with the criteria enumerated by Boswell and Cannon (2009) reveals that the report writing lacks consistency and clarity. The purpose for the research is clearly defined as the researcher hopes that their study, combined with past studies, will increase the overall knowledge and understanding of library and information scientists related to electronic archival finding aid displays. Despite being exhaustive in quantity and quality of reviewed research, the literature review lacks direction and focus toward the research study's purpose. Research questions the researcher poses aren't clearly linked to the rest of the report making it unsure where the questions came from that are driving the research project. The origins and reasons for the research study's design and methodology are not clearly explained. The study's reports and recommendations fall short in that they are presented as though the results from this study can apply to other archives and special collections organizations but the research and statistical methods used in the study lack the robustness required to be able to make generalizations about the results. Using a standard rubric for evaluating and critiquing research studies helps to objectively identify a study's strengths and weaknesses. This research methods critique demonstrates the ability to understand qualitative and quantitative research methods as well as evaluate research literature. \n\n\nINFO 285 Research Project Proposal\n\n\nResearch proposals are intended to persuade other scholars that are part of another committee or organization that the proposed research study contains the qualities of \"conceptual innovation, methodological rigor, and rich, substantive content\" (Przeworski and Salomon, 1995, p. 1). The proposal should answer 1) what will be learned from the research study, 2) why does the study matter, and 3) how can one know to trust the results (Przeworski and Salomon, 1995, p. 2). A class teaching research methods (INFO 285) that focused on library evaluation and assessment required creating a research project proposal that would evaluate and assess some program or aspect of a library. This research project proposal focused on evaluating and assessing the electronic archival finding aid interface and display for the L. Tom Perry Special Collections in the Harold B. Lee Library (HBLL) at Brigham Young University (BYU). The library's finding aid interface was redesigned almost eight years previously. This project proposal would request support to evaluate and assess whether the current finding aid display meets the needs of patrons to the library. \n\n\nThis final project was a semester-long effort tying together concepts related to library evaluation and assessment, research methods, and statistical analyses. A literature review and research study critique were assigned and completed as part of the preparation for completing this final project. Writing this proposal taught many practical things about the nature of a project proposal as compared to other types of written reports and literature. An example difference between writing a research proposal and other scholarly research literature is the audience for this proposal. This proposal is written for the approval of a committee of scholars who decide whether or not to fund the project. This difference in audience is manifest in the use of an executive summary rather than an abstract. The executive summary is the summation of the report and is more lengthly than a typical article abstract.\n\n\nThis project teaches the truth that a good research proposal starts with a clearly defined (and refined) research question. This sets the tone and focus of the entire proposal including the literature review, research design, methodology, and analysis. The proposal also taught about the importance of choosing the research and statistical methods that would be used in the study. This proposal relies upon both qualitative and quantitative methods. Surveys are used to gather information about the effectiveness of the current electronic archival finding aid interface. The information from the surveys is encoded so that a quantitative analysis can be performed on the gathered data.  \n\n\nEthical issues related to a research study proposal were also learned from this project. Since the proposed study involves human subjects the project required receiving training and certification through the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI program). This training would be required as a pre-requisite to receiving approval from an institutional review board (IRB). The IRB is meant to evaluate (using a risk-benefit analysis) whether or not the research study should be conducted. Also related to the ethics of a research study involving human subjects is the requirement of a consent form for participants to sign. The consent form clarifies what it means to participate in the study.\n\n\nThe design of the research study requires a clear understanding of the research question and purpose for the study. The questions that are asked determine the data that needs to be collected. The research proposal also requires understanding research study methodologies (e.g. survey, experiment, case studies, focus groups, content analysis, bibliometrics, ethnography) and identifying whether a method is qualitative or quantitative in nature or the combination of both. There is also a need to understand statistical analysis methods to accurately analyze and interpret data gathered from the project. There are ethical considerations to consider as well that can limit the kinds of information that can be collected as well as how data collected needs to be handled. \n\n\nThere are many components to writing a research study proposal that must be completed to receive approval, support, and funding. This research study proposal project gives experience navigating these various requirements. Completing this project proves that writing research proposals is as much an art as it is a science. \n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nLibrary and information science (LIS) has historically been more practical and professional in nature. Research and research methods training have not always been a focus or requirement for the education of information professionals. Research in LIS is immature and low in quantity and quality (Powell, 2008, p. 177). Like the leaves on the end of a tree are important so are efforts in LIS to focus on practical uses and applications of general (or basic) research. But without the roots, trunk, and branches to hold up the leaves the tree is no longer a tree but a pile of leaves. The leaves value and use are lost without the rest of the tree (Brady, 2015). Just as tree leaves need the roots, trunk, and branches and the roots, trunk, and branches need tree leaves, LIS needs practical application as well as basic research. Basic research gives life to practical applications; applications lead to new research. \n\n\nThe potential for LIS research to create and discover new truths and new ideas is enormous. The multi-disciplinary nature of the field positions it to receive and make significant contributions to humankind's knowledge. To tap into this potential requires learning, training, and practicing the use of qualitative and quantitative research methods, designing research projects, and evaluating and synthesizing research literature. Coursework completed in the SJSU MLIS program provided experience to learn these core principles of research. \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBoswell, C. & Cannon, S. (2009). Critique Process in C.

            "text": "The twelfth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to  \"demonstrate understanding of quantitative and qualitative research methods, the ability to design a research project, and the ability to evaluate and synthesize research literature\" .  Research is a rigorous, systematic process that examines and studies information to expand or apply human knowledge. Research has been classified into two main methods: basic and applied (National Science Foundation, 1953, p. 38). Basic research is \"concerned with creating new, generalizable knowledge\" while applied research is \"concerned with the solving of specific problems in real situations\" (Powell, 2008, p. 169). One type is focused on creating new theories and knowledge that can be broadly applied. The other is focused on discovering applications of the general theories and knowledge. Basic and applied research can be better understood by comparing research to trees: basic research is the broad trunk of the tree while applied research is the leaves at the tips of the branches (Brady, 2015). This implies that these two methods are seen as a continuum or spectrum. Research can fall somewhere between the two types of research rather than a binary categorization. Both types of research can feed into the other. Basic and applied research can also be either quantitative or qualitative in nature or some combination of the two. A quantitative approach means that the research is measurable using numerical means. A qualitative approach means that the research is focused on characteristics, qualities, events, and behaviors of the subject (or subjects) involved in the research.  While ideas for research questions and projects can come from various sources a common source comes from critical evaluation and synthesis of existing research literature. Using the results of research projects is limited if a librarian or information scientist lacks the ability to critically evaluate existing research projects (Powell, 2008, p. 177). Once a research topic and methodology are chosen the next step is designing a project that will help answer the original research questions. This will include determining the best method for capturing data that will help answer the research question. Research methods and techniques used to gather data include surveys, experiments, history and historical primary sources, case studies, focus groups, content analyses, bibliometrics, ethnography, grounded theory, phenomenology, hermeneutics, reflexivity, and discourse analysis. After data is collected that helps answer the original research question the data is analyzed. Data analysis includes organizing, summarizing, and generalizing the collected data to help identify patterns and draw conclusions. After the data is analyzed and summarized the researcher reports the research project's findings in some form of a report that can be communicated to individuals or groups with an interest in the results. Coursework completed in the SJSU MLIS program provided experience with these research concepts and processes.",

It doesn't add any new ideas but summarizes and synthesizes existing research and literature on a given subject. The organization and presentation of the literature review can vary but is centered around a particular research topic. The selected topic is used to search for sources related to the research topic. The literature review can be organized chronologically, methodologically, or thematically. The choice of organizational method depends upon the type and purpose of the literature review. A well constructed literature review explains why the review is being conducted. The body of the review can identify general trends, conflicts, gaps of research, or new perspectives in the related field.    To prepare for writing a research project proposal a library research methods course (INFO 285) required writing a literature review. Successfully writing this literature review required clearly defining the research question. The research question for this literature review is to evaluate and assess whether the electronic finding aid interface for the L. Tom Perry Special Collections in the Harold B. Lee Library (HBLL) at Brigham Young University (BYU) is meeting the needs of its patrons. The literature review explored this study question by looking at literature related to the display of electronic archival finding aids. Basic characteristics of all the sources was enumerated including how many years the research spanned, the methodologies taken by the research, and the statistical approaches of any research projects in the literature. After this introduction to the literature major themes are discussed that were discovered while evaluating each source. These themes included user groups, display elements, navigation and search, and content standards. After discussing these themes the conclusion highlights disagreement and gaps in the literature that present opportunities for further research and study. This assignment is evidence of learning how to evaluate and synthesize research literature.",

            "text": "Not all research studies are of equal value. The ability to critically evaluate a research study is a key part of understanding and applying principles and practices that will positively contribute to a given research domain (Boswell and Cannon, 2009, p. 292). As part of a larger effort in a library research methods course (INFO 285) a critique of an existing research study was written that related to a research project proposal. The research topic was about assessing the interface and display of electronic archival finding aids. The critique focused on the published results of a usability study aimed to assess the display of electronic archival finding aids at the Southern Historical Collection (Chapman, 2010). The rubric for critically assessing this study comes from criteria identified by Boswell and Cannon (2009). The critique examined the research study's report form, purpose, literature review, research questions, methodology, and results. The critique of the published research study reveals Chapman's assumptions, definitions, strengths, and limitations.   Comparing the research study with the criteria enumerated by Boswell and Cannon (2009) reveals that the report writing lacks consistency and clarity. The purpose for the research is clearly defined as the researcher hopes that their study, combined with past studies, will increase the overall knowledge and understanding of library and information scientists related to electronic archival finding aid displays. Despite being exhaustive in quantity and quality of reviewed research, the literature review lacks direction and focus toward the research study's purpose. Research questions the researcher poses aren't clearly linked to the rest of the report making it unsure where the questions came from that are driving the research project. The origins and reasons for the research study's design and methodology are not clearly explained. The study's reports and recommendations fall short in that they are presented as though the results from this study can apply to other archives and special collections organizations but the research and statistical methods used in the study lack the robustness required to be able to make generalizations about the results. Using a standard rubric for evaluating and critiquing research studies helps to objectively identify a study's strengths and weaknesses. This research methods critique demonstrates the ability to understand qualitative and quantitative research methods as well as evaluate research literature.",

            "text": "Research proposals are intended to persuade other scholars that are part of another committee or organization that the proposed research study contains the qualities of \"conceptual innovation, methodological rigor, and rich, substantive content\" (Przeworski and Salomon, 1995, p. 1). The proposal should answer 1) what will be learned from the research study, 2) why does the study matter, and 3) how can one know to trust the results (Przeworski and Salomon, 1995, p. 2). A class teaching research methods (INFO 285) that focused on library evaluation and assessment required creating a research project proposal that would evaluate and assess some program or aspect of a library. This research project proposal focused on evaluating and assessing the electronic archival finding aid interface and display for the L. Tom Perry Special Collections in the Harold B. Lee Library (HBLL) at Brigham Young University (BYU). The library's finding aid interface was redesigned almost eight years previously. This project proposal would request support to evaluate and assess whether the current finding aid display meets the needs of patrons to the library.   This final project was a semester-long effort tying together concepts related to library evaluation and assessment, research methods, and statistical analyses. A literature review and research study critique were assigned and completed as part of the preparation for completing this final project. Writing this proposal taught many practical things about the nature of a project proposal as compared to other types of written reports and literature. An example difference between writing a research proposal and other scholarly research literature is the audience for this proposal. This proposal is written for the approval of a committee of scholars who decide whether or not to fund the project. This difference in audience is manifest in the use of an executive summary rather than an abstract. The executive summary is the summation of the report and is more lengthly than a typical article abstract.  This project teaches the truth that a good research proposal starts with a clearly defined (and refined) research question. This sets the tone and focus of the entire proposal including the literature review, research design, methodology, and analysis. The proposal also taught about the importance of choosing the research and statistical methods that would be used in the study. This proposal relies upon both qualitative and quantitative methods. Surveys are used to gather information about the effectiveness of the current electronic archival finding aid interface. The information from the surveys is encoded so that a quantitative analysis can be performed on the gathered data.    Ethical issues related to a research study proposal were also learned from this project. Since the proposed study involves human subjects the project required receiving training and certification through the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI program). This training would be required as a pre-requisite to receiving approval from an institutional review board (IRB). The IRB is meant to evaluate (using a risk-benefit analysis) whether or not the research study should be conducted. Also related to the ethics of a research study involving human subjects is the requirement of a consent form for participants to sign. The consent form clarifies what it means to participate in the study.  The design of the research study requires a clear understanding of the research question and purpose for the study. The questions that are asked determine the data that needs to be collected. The research proposal also requires understanding research study methodologies (e.g. survey, experiment, case studies, focus groups, content analysis, bibliometrics, ethnography) and identifying whether a method is qualitative or quantitative in nature or the combination of both. There is also a need to understand statistical analysis methods to accurately analyze and interpret data gathered from the project. There are ethical considerations to consider as well that can limit the kinds of information that can be collected as well as how data collected needs to be handled.   There are many components to writing a research study proposal that must be completed to receive approval, support, and funding. This research study proposal project gives experience navigating these various requirements. Completing this project proves that writing research proposals is as much an art as it is a science.",

            "text": "Library and information science (LIS) has historically been more practical and professional in nature. Research and research methods training have not always been a focus or requirement for the education of information professionals. Research in LIS is immature and low in quantity and quality (Powell, 2008, p. 177). Like the leaves on the end of a tree are important so are efforts in LIS to focus on practical uses and applications of general (or basic) research. But without the roots, trunk, and branches to hold up the leaves the tree is no longer a tree but a pile of leaves. The leaves value and use are lost without the rest of the tree (Brady, 2015). Just as tree leaves need the roots, trunk, and branches and the roots, trunk, and branches need tree leaves, LIS needs practical application as well as basic research. Basic research gives life to practical applications; applications lead to new research.   The potential for LIS research to create and discover new truths and new ideas is enormous. The multi-disciplinary nature of the field positions it to receive and make significant contributions to humankind's knowledge. To tap into this potential requires learning, training, and practicing the use of qualitative and quantitative research methods, designing research projects, and evaluating and synthesizing research literature. Coursework completed in the SJSU MLIS program provided experience to learn these core principles of research.",

We live in an interconnected world and society that requires interaction and communication. To be an active participant within this world and society requires basic literacy skills: reading, writing, and speaking. The policy manual for the American Library Association (ALA) gives emphasis to \"the principle that lifelong literacy is a basic right for all individuals in our society and is essential to the welfare of the nation\" (ALA Council, 2013, p. 34). Information is of no value if it cannot be communicated. The work of an information professional relies upon these fundamental literacy skills. These literacy skills enable an organization to accomplish its mission, vision, and goals in serving the organization's staff, patrons, and clientele. An organization's leadership uses these literacy skills to assess and evaluate the organization's direction and progress. They also communicate the organization's mission and vision to the organization's staff. Information professionals within the organization collaborate in meetings, on committees and projects to help further the work and progress of the organization. Information professionals interact with the organization's patrons and clientele to help meet their information needs. The success of these interactions depends upon the oral and written communication skills of the information professional.\n\n\nThe success of a student in the SJSU MLIS program depends upon their ability to utilize and learn literacy skills to participate in coursework and assignments. Each course in the program includes multiple assignments and projects involving reading, writing, presenting, and collaborating. Successful completion of the SJSU MLIS program can't be achieved without these fundamental skills. In addition to providing opportunities to demonstrate these literacy skills, coursework in the SJSU MLIS program acted as training ground to practice and refine these skills. The SJSU MLIS program acts as a learning laboratory to prepare students to become actively engaged information professionals. \n\n\nEvidence\n\n\nThe following coursework demonstrates oral and written communication skills necessary for professional work including collaboration and presentations. \n\n\n\n\nScreencasts and presentations\n\n\nWritten reports and papers\n\n\nGroup projects\n\n\n\n\nScreencasts and Presentations\n\n\nThe health of an information organization rests upon the ability for its staff to communicate, present, and share ideas with each other and with the organization's patrons and clientele. Information and knowledge wants to be free and shared with others. This is where the true value of knowledge is derived. \n\n\nSharing and presenting knowledge is a vital skill in a professional work environment. The skill to present and share includes the ability to clearly and concisely articulate knowledge to others by verbal means. The presenter has to understand the material broadly and deeply to be able to share the essence and importance of particular issue or topic. They have to be able to identify the heart of the knowledge that needs to be shared knowing the audience that will view the presentation. In addition to the content being clear and well=formed the presentation delivery and style must be engaging and able to draw in the viewing audience so that they become engaged too. This requires deep preparation on the part of the presenter. \n\n\nSharing benefits the receiver and the giver. The receiver benefits from the effort of the giver to process, understand, synthesize, distill, and share knowledge and information. The giver benefits by reinforcing their knowledge and understanding through the process of sharing. \n\n\nIn the SJSU MLIS program there were many opportunities to present and share material to help meet the needs of others. The following screencasts and presentations were developed for courses in the SJSU MLIS program that demonstrate the skills of oral communication and presentation:\n\n\n\n\nLIBR 210 Tutorial: How to Make a Web Map\n\n\nINFO 247 Final Project Screencast: Thesaurus Construction\n\n\nINFO 244 Screencast: Library Database Training\n\n\nINFO 244 Final Project Screencast: EAD Finding Aids and Search\n\n\nLIBR 246 Final Project Screencast: Custom XML Schema\n\n\nINFO 220 Final Project: THATCamp Un-conference Proposal\n\n\nStrategic Plan for the Hingham Public Library\n\n\n\n\nProjects 1 and 3 acted as training or tutorial presentations that transform a potentially complex and overwhelming process into a set of easy-to-follow steps that the viewer can rely on to accomplish a particular task or goal. Projects 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are designed to share the end result of projects completed in the SJSU MLIS program. Projects 1-6 were recorded and uploaded as \nVimeo\n videos. Project 7 is a \nPrezi\n presentation. The medium of the presentation determines and shapes what and how material is presented. Video screencasts involve visual as well as audio content to convey the core message of the presentation. Slide-based presentations (e.g. Prezi, PowerPoint, Keynote, etc.) typically are visual in nature with little to no audio involved. Non-audio presentations must be able to convey the message in text and imagery without reliance upon audio. \n\n\nWhile each of these screencasts or presentations vary in the intended end-user, content matter, and medium used to present the material, there are common principles of communication and presentation that apply to each of these various presentations. Viewers have a limited attention span and their time is valuable. Each of these presentations were crafted with brevity and concision. Each presentation attempts to be clear about their purpose and meaning. Each presentation was planned, drafted, reviewed, and practiced multiple times to ensure smooth and clear delivery. These presentations stand as evidence demonstrating oral and presentation communication skills that are essential in a professional work environment. \n\n\nWritten Reports and Papers\n\n\nWriting is, has been, and will continue to be a de facto medium for disseminated knowledge and information. Writing clearly and effectively is essential to the work performed by information professionals as they collect, organize, and make available information to meet the needs of their patrons or clientele. Like presentations writing requires clarity and concision so that the reader is clear about the purpose of the written material. It requires the ability to organize thoughts and ideas in clear, logical patterns and groupings. This requires broad and deep understanding and preparation of the material to be shared in written word. The SJSU MLIS program offered multiple opportunities to practice and demonstrate skills related to communicating through writing. The following items are a curated sample of written work that demonstrates the skills to communication through the written word:\n\n\n\n\nLIBR 202 Term Paper: Geographic Information Retrieval\n\n\nLIBR 204 Essay: Good to Great Leadership\n\n\nLIBR 210 Library Guide\n\n\nLIBR 210 Annotated Bibliography\n\n\nINFO 285 Research Methods Critique\n\n\nINFO 285 Literature Review\n\n\nINFO 285 Research Project Proposal\n\n\n\n\nEach of these projects varies in terms of the content material and in the form used to present the written communication. Items 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 are written in a report or essay form following the \nAmerican Psychological Association (APA)\n \nwriting style\n. Items 3 and 4 are materials written on the World Wide Web (WWW). Despite the differences in form, audience, and presentation each of these written items required a broad and deep level of understanding the subject matter and content material that is included in each item. Each involved a process of brainstorming to capture ideas about the given subject area to explore themes and ideas that can be shared in the written item. Each required having a clear idea of the purpose behind each written item. The writing of each of the items also included study and research to collect and organize scholarly references and bibliographic materials. They all follow a similar pattern of introducing a topic, stating the main purpose or thesis for the material, presenting arguments and ideas to support the thesis, and then concluding with restating the thesis and summarizing the items main points. Each of these written items demonstrate the written communication skills necessary for professional work.\n\n\nGroup Projects\n\n\nInformation professionals work in environments and information organizations that require collaboration. In today's interconnected world they cannot afford to work alone isolated from others. The success of the work of an information professional and their organization depends upon their ability to reach out to others in a spirit of collaboration and constructive group effort. Information organizations are part of a larger social ecology that includes multiple individuals. Work functions and responsibilities are closely connected to the relationships between individuals in an organization. Accomplishing the mission, vision, and goals of the organization are only possible with collaboration and group efforts. The following group projects completed in the SJSU MLIS program demonstrate communication skills related to collaboratio: \n\n\n\n\nLIBR 202 Group Database Design\n\n\nLIBR 247 Final Project: Thesaurus Construction\n\n\nLIBR 204 Strategic Plan Project\n\n\n\n\nEach of these projects represents the culmination in team efforts to accomplish a particular course requirement. Item 1 was a two-phase project to learn principles and theory related to information retrieval and database design. Item 2 was a group project to create a thesaurus. Item 3 was a two-phase group project to create a strategic plan for an existing public library. While each of these projects were different in terms of the subject matter, length of project, and project outputs, the skills related to collaboration and group work apply equally to each project. \n\n\nEach project required synchronous and asynchronous communication including emails, texts, chat, and live group meetings. Each project required getting to know each team member. Each player on the team had to know their role and responsibilities and be accountable for their parts of the project. While all projects were ultimately successful in the final project outputs, not all followed the same path to achieve those results. Each of these projects proved the truth \"that the key to successful teams is group goals and individual accountability\" (Haycock, 2007). When the team goals, expectations, and role accountability was in place and clearly communicated and reviewed the group work went smoothly. In these cases the focus stayed on accomplishing the work rather than addressing group politics, conflicts, or dynamics. When team goals, roles, and responsibilities were not clearly stated and understood there was more tension and conflict when work was either not completed, completed with duplicate effort, or completed with low quality. Each project demonstrated the value of consistent, clear communication between group members. Following up with assignments and offering others help in a spirit of friendship and care were additional key principles that led to successful collaboration efforts. \n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nThe work environment of the information professional is ever changing and adapting to a world of technological advancement and interconnectedness. Just as in society communication has always been an essential reality with information organizations. While advancements in communications technologies provide new ways to communicate and collaborate there are core principles that apply to the work of information professionals independent of technology. Even in a new digital world with online video, blogs, vlogs, chat, email, and instant messaging the communication skills of speaking, writing, sharing, and collaborating are still valuable and important for the work of an information professional. The fundamental principles of communication apply to all communication modes. There will always be a need to disseminate the knowledge and understanding one holds and discovers with others. Social understanding and edification can only come through clear, effective communication: speaking, writing, presenting, and collaborating. This is how societies advance. Being able to organize ideas and evidence in a logical structure that can be clearly and concisely communicated is essential to the work of an information professional for this is how they contribute constructively to their organizations and communities. Presentations, written materials, and group projects completed in the SJSU MLIS program demonstrate the oral and written communication skills necessary to perform the work of an information professional.  \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nALA Council.

The following screencasts and presentations were developed for courses in the SJSU MLIS program that demonstrate the skills of oral communication and presentation:   LIBR 210 Tutorial: How to Make a Web Map  INFO 247 Final Project Screencast: Thesaurus Construction  INFO 244 Screencast: Library Database Training  INFO 244 Final Project Screencast: EAD Finding Aids and Search  LIBR 246 Final Project Screencast: Custom XML Schema  INFO 220 Final Project: THATCamp Un-conference Proposal  Strategic Plan for the Hingham Public Library   Projects 1 and 3 acted as training or tutorial presentations that transform a potentially complex and overwhelming process into a set of easy-to-follow steps that the viewer can rely on to accomplish a particular task or goal. Projects 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are designed to share the end result of projects completed in the SJSU MLIS program. Projects 1-6 were recorded and uploaded as  Vimeo  videos. Project 7 is a  Prezi  presentation. The medium of the presentation determines and shapes what and how material is presented. Video screencasts involve visual as well as audio content to convey the core message of the presentation. Slide-based presentations (e.g. Prezi, PowerPoint, Keynote, etc.) typically are visual in nature with little to no audio involved. Non-audio presentations must be able to convey the message in text and imagery without reliance upon audio.   While each of these screencasts or presentations vary in the intended end-user, content matter, and medium used to present the material, there are common principles of communication and presentation that apply to each of these various presentations. Viewers have a limited attention span and their time is valuable. Each of these presentations were crafted with brevity and concision. Each presentation attempts to be clear about their purpose and meaning. Each presentation was planned, drafted, reviewed, and practiced multiple times to ensure smooth and clear delivery. These presentations stand as evidence demonstrating oral and presentation communication skills that are essential in a professional work environment.",

Writing clearly and effectively is essential to the work performed by information professionals as they collect, organize, and make available information to meet the needs of their patrons or clientele. Like presentations writing requires clarity and concision so that the reader is clear about the purpose of the written material. It requires the ability to organize thoughts and ideas in clear, logical patterns and groupings. This requires broad and deep understanding and preparation of the material to be shared in written word. The SJSU MLIS program offered multiple opportunities to practice and demonstrate skills related to communicating through writing. The following items are a curated sample of written work that demonstrates the skills to communication through the written word:   LIBR 202 Term Paper: Geographic Information Retrieval  LIBR 204 Essay: Good to Great Leadership  LIBR 210 Library Guide  LIBR 210 Annotated Bibliography  INFO 285 Research Methods Critique  INFO 285 Literature Review  INFO 285 Research Project Proposal   Each of these projects varies in terms of the content material and in the form used to present the written communication. Items 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 are written in a report or essay form following the  American Psychological Association (APA)   writing style . Items 3 and 4 are materials written on the World Wide Web (WWW). Despite the differences in form, audience, and presentation each of these written items required a broad and deep level of understanding the subject matter and content material that is included in each item. Each involved a process of brainstorming to capture ideas about the given subject area to explore themes and ideas that can be shared in the written item. Each required having a clear idea of the purpose behind each written item. The writing of each of the items also included study and research to collect and organize scholarly references and bibliographic materials. They all follow a similar pattern of introducing a topic, stating the main purpose or thesis for the material, presenting arguments and ideas to support the thesis, and then concluding with restating the thesis and summarizing the items main points.

In today's interconnected world they cannot afford to work alone isolated from others. The success of the work of an information professional and their organization depends upon their ability to reach out to others in a spirit of collaboration and constructive group effort. Information organizations are part of a larger social ecology that includes multiple individuals. Work functions and responsibilities are closely connected to the relationships between individuals in an organization. Accomplishing the mission, vision, and goals of the organization are only possible with collaboration and group efforts. The following group projects completed in the SJSU MLIS program demonstrate communication skills related to collaboratio:    LIBR 202 Group Database Design  LIBR 247 Final Project: Thesaurus Construction  LIBR 204 Strategic Plan Project   Each of these projects represents the culmination in team efforts to accomplish a particular course requirement. Item 1 was a two-phase project to learn principles and theory related to information retrieval and database design. Item 2 was a group project to create a thesaurus. Item 3 was a two-phase group project to create a strategic plan for an existing public library. While each of these projects were different in terms of the subject matter, length of project, and project outputs, the skills related to collaboration and group work apply equally to each project.   Each project required synchronous and asynchronous communication including emails, texts, chat, and live group meetings. Each project required getting to know each team member. Each player on the team had to know their role and responsibilities and be accountable for their parts of the project. While all projects were ultimately successful in the final project outputs, not all followed the same path to achieve those results. Each of these projects proved the truth \"that the key to successful teams is group goals and individual accountability\" (Haycock, 2007). When the team goals, expectations, and role accountability was in place and clearly communicated and reviewed the group work went smoothly. In these cases the focus stayed on accomplishing the work rather than addressing group politics, conflicts, or dynamics. When team goals, roles, and responsibilities were not clearly stated and understood there was more tension and conflict when work was either not completed, completed with duplicate effort, or completed with low quality. Each project demonstrated the value of consistent, clear communication between group members. Following up with assignments and offering others help in a spirit of friendship and care were additional key principles that led to successful collaboration efforts.",

Just as in society communication has always been an essential reality with information organizations. While advancements in communications technologies provide new ways to communicate and collaborate there are core principles that apply to the work of information professionals independent of technology. Even in a new digital world with online video, blogs, vlogs, chat, email, and instant messaging the communication skills of speaking, writing, sharing, and collaborating are still valuable and important for the work of an information professional. The fundamental principles of communication apply to all communication modes. There will always be a need to disseminate the knowledge and understanding one holds and discovers with others. Social understanding and edification can only come through clear, effective communication: speaking, writing, presenting, and collaborating. This is how societies advance. Being able to organize ideas and evidence in a logical structure that can be clearly and concisely communicated is essential to the work of an information professional for this is how they contribute constructively to their organizations and communities.

The purpose behind evaluation is to provide feedback to influence making decisions or policies. Without evaluation an individual, group, or organization is blind to their progress towards an aim or goal. Evaluation is used by information organizations to \"[determine] the success, impact, results, costs, outcomes, or other factors related to a library activity, program, service, or resource use\" (McClure, 2008, p. 179). An information organization uses evaluation as a means to determine how well they meet the needs of their patrons or clientele and how wisely they are using their allocated resources. Evaluation helps focus the organization on the priorities and efforts that give the greatest impact and benefit to their communities. This process of evaluation helps information organizations ensure that the day-to-day work and efforts are aligned with the organization's mission, vision, and strategic goals. \n\n\nAs the purpose and focus of information organizations shifts they have an important need to show their continued value in a changing society. To show their value they will need to ask the right questions to find answers that demonstrate their importance and value within society. Traditionally information organizations have focused on building their collections and so the value and quality of the organization was tied to the size of their collections (Hernon and Altman, 2010, p. 2). Assessing and evaluating the value of an information organization requires asking questions better focused on their modern-day purpose and function. \n\n\nAsking the right questions and then gathering the right data to accurately measure how things really are within an organization is a challenging aspect of evaluation and assessment. Information organizations (or more specifically libraries) do well at collecting usage statistics. The idea has been that if \"libraries are used, they are of value to the users\" (Tenopir, 2012, p. 6). These kinds of measures are focused on measuring the inputs and outputs to libraries but miss the processes and outcomes that come from a library. This includes understanding the needs of library patrons and their satisfaction with library services. \n\n\nThe evaluation process utilizes measures and quality standards. Measures identify the observed state or value of a particular program or service at a particular moment in time. The evaluation process can utilize many different types of measures including performance measures (i.e. how well something is performed), output measures (i.e. the result of a program or service), and outcome measures (i.e. the impact of a program or service on something else). Quality standards are the desired quality or performance level of an organization's program or service. Evaluation criteria focuses on the following questions (McClure, 2008, p. 182-183):\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the quantity of a given service or program?\n\n\nHow well were resources used in relation to time and money?\n\n\nHow well does the service or program achieve the mission, vision, and goals of the organization?\n\n\nWhat is the quality of the service or program provided?\n\n\nWhat is the impact of a service or program on the organization, staff, patrons, or community?\n\n\nHow useful is a service or program to its users?\n\n\n\n\nAs the right questions are asked and measured information organizations will position themselves to be able to demonstrate their value to their patrons and communities. Coursework in the SJSU MLIS program provided training and experience to evaluate programs and services using measurable criteria.\n\n\nEvidence\n\n\nThe following projects and assignments demonstrates experience evaluating programs and services using measurable criteria.\n\n\n\n\nReference interview evaluation\n\n\nEvaluation research project proposal\n\n\nDiscussion post: Evaluating the library's physical space\n\n\nDiscussion post: Evaluating library IT service\n\n\nDiscussion post: Evaluating library patron feedback\n\n\n\n\nLIBR 210 Reference Interview Evaluation\n\n\nEvaluating the interaction between patrons and the staff of an information organization is one way to determine whether the organization is meeting the needs of its community. Reference interviews are one type of interaction where staff of the organization converse with a patron to identify their information need and direct them to resources that will satisfy that need. Evaluating reference interviews helps an information organization know the best way to provide reference services to its patrons or clientele. \n\n\nAn assignment for a reference and information services course (LIBR 210) provided an opportunity to evaluate a hypothetical reference interview. The assignment shows a possible interaction between patron and reference librarian involving a legal question. The interactions were measured against the RUSA (2013) \nGuidelines for Behavioral Performance of Reference and Information Service Providers\n as well as the RUSA (2001) \nGuidelines for Medical, Legal, and Business Responses\n. The success of this reference interview involves striking an appropriate balance between serving the patron in finding resources to answer their questions while also following the ethic and written library policy that the librarian is not able to provide authoritative legal counsel. A RUSA guideline was correlated with each reference interview transaction. The interactions were successful based on their matching the ideal described in the guidelines. The RUSA guidelines are valuable tools to help evaluate the quality and usefulness of reference services. These guidelines help reference librarians stay objective through the reference interview process while still allowing the patron freedom to express their views and beliefs. The guidelines are also beneficial by helping the librarian focus on helping patrons learn to learn by showing them resources that answer their information needs. \n\n\nINFO 285 Research Project Proposal\n\n\nThe evaluation of services and programs offered by an information organization requires collecting data that will help answer questions that help measure the success of the service or program. A final project for a research methods course (INFO 285) involved writing a research study proposal to evaluate a chosen library service or program. This project focused on submitting a proposal to evaluate an online archival finding aid interface for the L. Tom Perry Special Collections at the Harold B. Lee Library (HBLL) on the campus of Brigham Young University (BYU). Online archival finding aids are used by archives and special collections to show staff and patrons what items are contained in an archive or collection and where those items are located. \n\n\nThe finding aid interface for the Perry Special Collections was redesigned seven years ago. Because of the rapid changes in mobile computing technology since the interface was redesigned this research study would evaluate how well the finding aids interface meet the needs of staff and patrons using mobile computing devices. To help measure the effectiveness of the finding aid interface data will be collected by conducting a usability study of the interface. \n\n\nArchival library staff, campus faculty, undergraduate students, and graduate students will be asked to participate in the study. Participants will perform tasks using mobile devices (i.e. a tablet and smartphone) that require them to navigate and use the finding aid interface. A researcher will observe the completion of these tasks and record the results on an evaluation form that determines whether a task was completed or not and the length of time it took to complete the task. Surveys will be given to participants before and after the usability test. The pre-test survey will provide background information about the participant. The post-test survey will gauge customer satisfaction with the interface and allow comments to be shared. In addition to data collected from a usability study server logs for the finding aid interface web application will be collected and anonymized. These general usage statistics will help to see the popularity of the EAD interface, areas within the web application that received the most use, and how many visitors to the web application used a mobile computing device. \n\n\nThe surveys include ordinal, nominal, and interval variables that can be interpreted using quantitative measures like frequency, averages, and variability. These measures can help identify patterns related to study participant characteristics, their use of the finding aid interface, and the level of satisfaction with the interface. Usability test question results will be analyzed to identify the success level of a participant with the finding aid interface. Usability test questions that are a struggle for a majority of participants to complete successfully will indicate ineffective areas in the finding aid interface that may need to be redesigned for use on a mobile device. The survey results will be correlated with the usability test results to identify patterns that would indicate the effectiveness of the finding aid interface in meeting the needs of the participant. Qualitative comments in the post-test survey will be plotted on a quadrant analysis chart (Hernon and Altman, 2010, p. 156-158) to visually identify how well the service meets of the study participants. The chart compares customer satisfaction with service quality and would reveal how the expectations of the participant coincides with their level of satisfaction. The qualitative analysis results can then be compared with the usability test results. Usability test tasks where a participant is unsuccessful should correspond to low customer satisfaction and low service quality. Usability tests where the customer is successful should map to high customer satisfaction and high service quality. By performing statistical analysis on data collected from surveys, a usability study, and the server logs from a web application this research study proposal demonstrates a way to evaluate a library service using measurable criteria. \n\n\nINFO 285 Discussion Post: Evaluating the Library's Physical Space\n\n\nA crucial step in evaluating services and programs is asking the right questions that lead to relevant answers for evaluating the service or program. These questions and answers need to be aligned with measurable criteria that can effectively evaluate the service or program. A discussion post for a research methods course (INFO 285) explored an initial idea for evaluating a library's use of their physical space. The evaluation would try to answer what the impact would be on an academic library if they moved a majority of their physical collection to compact storage and freed up more space on each floor for other uses. \n\n\nThis discussion post explores quantitative and qualitative measures that could be used to answer this question. Answering this question requires understanding how the current library materials are utilized. Quantitative data about the library's current inventory and its utilization over time could be used. If there is high utilization of the current physical items available to patrons removing those items may impact patrons' use of the library and its materials. Qualitative data could be gathered using surveys and interviews to evaluate how students, faculty, and staff at the university use the physical items in the library. Evaluating the impact of moving physical items in an academic library would be based on measures related to current and historical usage of the library materials. \n\n\nINFO 285 Discussion Post: Evaluating Library IT Service\n\n\nLibrary IT staff provide various services to the library and its community. With the increase of a library's reliance on computing hardware and software to provide the services and programs offered by a library it is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of Library IT services. One question to help evaluate this effectiveness is:\n\n\n\n\nDoes equipment work when it has been repaired?\n\n\n\n\nTo answer this question involves knowing the context and scope of this particular issue. This would initially involve identifying the existing equipment available in the library. Gathering this information could be done with surveys or interviews with each division in the library. A tracking system could be developed to facilitate knowing what equipment is utilized in the library and by whom. A next step in answering this question involves asking tracking when and how equipment fails. When failure occurs a staff member would be assigned to repair the equipment. The time it took to repair the equipment would also need to be tracked. Once an item is repaired and the original employee or department reporting the failure is notified they would need to review the repair and verify that the problem was resolved. The organization would need to agree upon the methods and measures for tracking equipment failures, repairs, and verification of the repair. This agreement would include knowing what constitutes equipment being repaired. Without this agreement there would be a level of subjectivity relative to the technician's and patron's view of repaired equipment. There needs to be a clear understanding of what is considered a quality service offering. This discussion post demonstrates the need to understand the context of a service or program being evaluated and the need to have a clear set of measurable criteria and quality standards to effectively compare a service's or program's current level of quality. \n\n\nINFO 285 Discussion Post: Evaluating Library Patron Feedback\n\n\nTo be an adaptive and continually improving information organization that is relevant and valuable in the lives of those the organization serves requires focusing on the needs of patrons or clientele. Evaluating a service or program includes measuring the effectiveness, service quality, impact, and usefulness of the service or program in relation to its patrons or clientele. To perform this evaluation effectively for an organization requires receiving and handling patron feedback.\n\n\nA discussion post for a research methods course (INFO 285) discussed issues related to an organization's use and handling of customer feedback. Evaluation efforts should utilize customer feedback as a way to evaluate the success of a service or program. This user feedback system would require working with library staff to determine where the information organization stands in relation to receiving and responding to customer feedback. Asking and answering the following types of questions can motivate the organization's staff and leadership to evaluate where they are in regard to meeting the needs of patrons and what improvements can be made to elevate the level of service.\n\n\n\n\nHow are complaints perceived by staff and leaders in the organization?\n\n\nHow do staff respond to complaints?\n\n\nAre staff excited to respond to customer feedback?\n\n\nWhat is a given department doing currently to listen to the voice of the customer or patron?\n\n\n\n\nEstablishing a customer feedback system would be part of the measurable criteria that an organization uses to evaluate its services and programs. Establishing a system for receiving and handling patron or clientele feedback builds confidence in the organization being able to respond to the needs of its patrons or clientele. Confident patrons lead to satisfied patrons which in turn can lead to loyal patrons (Hernon and Altman, 2010).   \n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nAt their core information organizations are the people that work within them. People are imperfect beings that make mistakes and can lead an organization down inefficient and ineffective paths and activities. Evaluation corrects for these imperfections and redirect an organization and its staff towards service excellence. Evaluation also helps information organizations and their staff adapt to their changing environment. To ensure success in adapting to a changing environment and maintain relevance and value in the lives of an organization's patrons or clientele evaluation is best performed regularly on an ongoing, iterative basis. Information organizations need to develop an evaluation culture that is focused on measuring (and improving) services and programs offered by the organization. This requires identifying and utilizing measurable criteria and agreed upon quality standards that are used when evaluating an organization's services and programs. Coursework completed in the SJSU MLIS program provided experience evaluating services and programs using measurable criteria. \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAmerican Library Association.

Qualitative comments in the post-test survey will be plotted on a quadrant analysis chart (Hernon and Altman, 2010, p. 156-158) to visually identify how well the service meets of the study participants. The chart compares customer satisfaction with service quality and would reveal how the expectations of the participant coincides with their level of satisfaction. The qualitative analysis results can then be compared with the usability test results. Usability test tasks where a participant is unsuccessful should correspond to low customer satisfaction and low service quality. Usability tests where the customer is successful should map to high customer satisfaction and high service quality. By performing statistical analysis on data collected from surveys, a usability study, and the server logs from a web application this research study proposal demonstrates a way to evaluate a library service using measurable criteria.",

            "text": "A crucial step in evaluating services and programs is asking the right questions that lead to relevant answers for evaluating the service or program. These questions and answers need to be aligned with measurable criteria that can effectively evaluate the service or program. A discussion post for a research methods course (INFO 285) explored an initial idea for evaluating a library's use of their physical space. The evaluation would try to answer what the impact would be on an academic library if they moved a majority of their physical collection to compact storage and freed up more space on each floor for other uses.   This discussion post explores quantitative and qualitative measures that could be used to answer this question. Answering this question requires understanding how the current library materials are utilized. Quantitative data about the library's current inventory and its utilization over time could be used. If there is high utilization of the current physical items available to patrons removing those items may impact patrons' use of the library and its materials. Qualitative data could be gathered using surveys and interviews to evaluate how students, faculty, and staff at the university use the physical items in the library. Evaluating the impact of moving physical items in an academic library would be based on measures related to current and historical usage of the library materials.",

            "text": "Library IT staff provide various services to the library and its community. With the increase of a library's reliance on computing hardware and software to provide the services and programs offered by a library it is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of Library IT services. One question to help evaluate this effectiveness is:   Does equipment work when it has been repaired?   To answer this question involves knowing the context and scope of this particular issue. This would initially involve identifying the existing equipment available in the library. Gathering this information could be done with surveys or interviews with each division in the library. A tracking system could be developed to facilitate knowing what equipment is utilized in the library and by whom. A next step in answering this question involves asking tracking when and how equipment fails. When failure occurs a staff member would be assigned to repair the equipment. The time it took to repair the equipment would also need to be tracked. Once an item is repaired and the original employee or department reporting the failure is notified they would need to review the repair and verify that the problem was resolved. The organization would need to agree upon the methods and measures for tracking equipment failures, repairs, and verification of the repair. This agreement would include knowing what constitutes equipment being repaired. Without this agreement there would be a level of subjectivity relative to the technician's and patron's view of repaired equipment. There needs to be a clear understanding of what is considered a quality service offering. This discussion post demonstrates the need to understand the context of a service or program being evaluated and the need to have a clear set of measurable criteria and quality standards to effectively compare a service's or program's current level of quality.",

            "text": "To be an adaptive and continually improving information organization that is relevant and valuable in the lives of those the organization serves requires focusing on the needs of patrons or clientele. Evaluating a service or program includes measuring the effectiveness, service quality, impact, and usefulness of the service or program in relation to its patrons or clientele. To perform this evaluation effectively for an organization requires receiving and handling patron feedback.  A discussion post for a research methods course (INFO 285) discussed issues related to an organization's use and handling of customer feedback. Evaluation efforts should utilize customer feedback as a way to evaluate the success of a service or program. This user feedback system would require working with library staff to determine where the information organization stands in relation to receiving and responding to customer feedback. Asking and answering the following types of questions can motivate the organization's staff and leadership to evaluate where they are in regard to meeting the needs of patrons and what improvements can be made to elevate the level of service.   How are complaints perceived by staff and leaders in the organization?  How do staff respond to complaints?  Are staff excited to respond to customer feedback?  What is a given department doing currently to listen to the voice of the customer or patron?   Establishing a customer feedback system would be part of the measurable criteria that an organization uses to evaluate its services and programs. Establishing a system for receiving and handling patron or clientele feedback builds confidence in the organization being able to respond to the needs of its patrons or clientele. Confident patrons lead to satisfied patrons which in turn can lead to loyal patrons (Hernon and Altman, 2010).",

            "text": "At their core information organizations are the people that work within them. People are imperfect beings that make mistakes and can lead an organization down inefficient and ineffective paths and activities. Evaluation corrects for these imperfections and redirect an organization and its staff towards service excellence. Evaluation also helps information organizations and their staff adapt to their changing environment. To ensure success in adapting to a changing environment and maintain relevance and value in the lives of an organization's patrons or clientele evaluation is best performed regularly on an ongoing, iterative basis. Information organizations need to develop an evaluation culture that is focused on measuring (and improving) services and programs offered by the organization. This requires identifying and utilizing measurable criteria and agreed upon quality standards that are used when evaluating an organization's services and programs. Coursework completed in the SJSU MLIS program provided experience evaluating services and programs using measurable criteria.",

I love learning about visual art, science, language, literature, history, geography, mathematics, music, and religion and finding ways that technology can be used to better my understanding of these subjects. The interchange of technology and liberal arts is where my interests lie. Libraries stand at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts. My progress through the \nSJSU MLIS program\n, focusing on web development, proves this to be true. \n\n\nThe courses taken in this program prepared me to achieve my dream of working with technology in an academic library. While in my second year of the program I applied for a software developer position with the \nHarold B. Lee Library\n at \nBrigham Young University (BYU)\n. Although slightly off course from my previous professional employment my technical experience combined with my MLIS coursework enabled me to get the job. Since the end of 2014 I have been working full-time as a \nData Services Engineer\n. I love my job and work with the HBLL. I work on the web development team within the library's IT division to support the library's \nvision and mission\n. Working in an academic library while finishing my masters degree has been very instructional. Courses and assignments completed in the MLIS program have helped me accomplish my web development role in the library and better understand the work of an academic library and my colleagues in the library. My work in an academic library also influences my understanding of the course material completed in the SJSU MLIS program helping me contribute to discussions and on projects. With this new perspective I am better able to contribute to the library in my position both through my web development work and through working with non-IT library staff. \n\n\nPart of my position at the HBLL includes supporting Digital Scholarship (DS) and Digital Humanities (DH) efforts. Taking a course on the Digital Humanities (INFO 220) and a course on XML (LIBR 246) motivates me to continue the pursuit of combining my love and interest for computers and technology with the efforts of the HBLL in supporting the liberal arts, DS, and DH. The web application tool \nATOM (A Table of Metadata)\n is an example of a current project that supports these kinds of academic efforts. I also plan to contribute to the academic library community in publishing and contributing to and releasing open source software projects that will benefit the larger library communities. \n\n\nWhile this conclusion marks an end to the work in the SJSU MLIS program it also marks a beginning to positively contribute my talents and learning towards bettering the HBLL and the community it serves. \n\n\nThis is my portfolio. There are many like it, but this one is mine.",
