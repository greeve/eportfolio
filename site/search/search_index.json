            "text": "After Steve Jobs introduced the iPad at the January 27, 2010 Apple Keynote (Apple, 2010) he commented on why Apple is able to make the kind of products they make:\n\n\n\n\nNow the reason that Apple is able to create products like the iPad is because we\u2019ve always tried to be at the intersection of technology and liberal arts. To be able to get the best of both. To make extremely advanced products from a technology point of view but also have them be intuitive, easy to use, fun to use so that they really fit the users; the users don\u2019t have to come to them; they come to the user. And its the combination of these two things that I think has let us make the kind of creative products like the iPad.\n\n\n\n\nStanding at the intersection of technology and liberal arts is an idea that keenly resonates with me. As I reflect on my experience with libraries and in the \nSan Jose State University (SJSU) Masters of Library and Information Science (MLIS) program\n I see a parallel between Jobs' statement about creating the iPad and the value of the library. \n\n\nLibraries also stand at the intersection of technology and liberal arts. Libraries strive to bring out the best in both technology and the liberal arts. Libraries and information organizations provide services and products that span multiple disciplines and strive to be intuitive, easy to use, and fun to use. They continue to improve in becoming user-centric and working to meet the needs of their patrons and clientele. It was this idea that brought me to pursue a MLIS from SJSU and continues to drive my passion today. \n\n\nAfter graduating with \nBS in Geography\n from \nBrigham Young University (BYU)\n in 2007 I worked professionally in the field of computerized mapping and Geographic Information Systems. During this time I developed an interest to pursue a masters degree in library and information science. I wanted to shift my professional career towards working in an academic library utilizing computer and technology skills gained from my school, professional, and personal experience. I started the \nSJSU MLIS program\n in the Fall semester of 2013. With every course my love for libraries and desire to shift careers increased.\n\n\nThis portfolio is the culminating result of this degree. The portfolio is divided up into the following sections:\n\n\n\n\nStatement of Professional Philosophy\n: A statement that expresses my personal philosophy of librarianship and how libraries contribute to the cultural, economic, educational and social well-being of our communities. \n\n\nCompetencies\n: Statements of competency for the \nSJSU MLIS 14 core competencies\n.\n\n\nConclusion\n: Concluding statements including reflections on the MLIS program. \n\n\nAffirmation\n: A statement affirmation this work is mine and mine alone and that the portfolio is password-protected and privacy of others is respected.\n\n\n\n\nEach statement of competency includes evidence gathered from the assignments and projects completed during the MLIS program. These pieces of evidence were collected and saved after each semester for the purpose of utilizing them in this portfolio. Evidence includes links to PDF files of submitted work or links to external content including screencasts and external sites hosting previously submitted assignments. You are invited to view my portfolio for INFO 289 to complete my MLIS at SJSU.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nApple. (2010, January 27). Apple announces ipad. [Episode 26]. \nApple Keynotes\n.

            "text": "We live in an age of rapid technological advancement. What was once considered science fiction is now reality. We now carry in our pockets mini-computers capable of communicating wirelessly across large geographies! Despite these significant advancements there continues to be severe economic disparity in accessing these new technologies and learning the skills needed to take advantage of these technologies. This economic inequality is referred to as the \u201cdigital divide.\u201d Libraries are working hard to close this divide so more people have the access and the skills necessary to be part of our changing, digital world. Rubin (2010) provides an area of focus where libraries can help close the digital divide stating, \u201cAs more and more information becomes available online, there is a tremendous need to teach effective search techniques and evaluation skills\u201d (p. 178). Like the digital divide there are many other \"divides\" within a community including cultural, educational, and social divides. These gaps in understanding push individuals and communities apart and can lead to miscommunication and mistrust. The library stands at the intersection of communities, technologies, and the liberal arts. They are positioned in society to be a force for good in closing these gaps that exist. By reflecting on my personal experiences with libraries, one can see the impact libraries have in contributing to the cultural, economic, educational, and social well-being of a community in helping to bridge these divides.\n\n\nI remember going often to my elementary school library. In that library and as a young student I first learned about computers and the information superhighway. There I received hands-on instruction using computers for word processing, printing documents, using computer programs like Oregon Trail and Word Munchers, keyboard typing, and HyperCard. My elementary school library taught me basic computer skills and curiosity with digital technologies that has informed my interests and pursuits to the present day. In my school library I watched documentaries and read books about social, economic, and political issues that introduced me to new ideas and cultures. \n\n\nMy family didn't have Internet access in our home until late into my high school years. The High School library computers were the first computers I used to understand and explore the World Wide Web. I relied on the school library computers to access information online for school assignments and research papers. School libraries provided a way for me to develop skills in searching and retrieving information from the Internet that weren't possible previously. The high-school library also provided a place of interaction and connection with friends before and after school. We used the library to socialize, share ideas, and work on homework together. \n\n\nPublic libraries were also important to me in my youth. Individually and with my family I would regularly go to local public libraries to check out books, magazines, music CDs, and movies. At the public library I would use the Internet for checking email and browsing the web. Access to the public library computers helped me apply for summer jobs while in between school years. Public libraries closed the digital divide for me by giving me access to the Internet and allowing me to connect to the digital world. Before a personal identification card, drivers license, or credit card I owned my own library card. Having a library card that I was responsible for strengthened my confidence and independence. It was empowering to checkout out my own materials myself without reliance on my parents or siblings and to be part of the local library community. Visiting the library and seeing members of the community there engaging in various educational, business, or recreational pursuits was energizing and motivating. \n\n\nMy first introduction to academic libraries was in high school for an English class research paper. To gather research information for this assignment as well as introduce us to an academic library, our English class took a field trip to a local University library. I was amazed at the size and scale of the library as well as the large number of digital services available for college students. Working in the academic library instilled within me confidence and excitement to pursue additional education at the university level. Later, as a college student at \nBrigham Young University (BYU)\n, I relied heavily on the digital resources available in the university library for completing assignments and staying in touch with family over email. The college library computers provided me access to the Internet and other computing technologies when I couldn't afford to pay for them myself. It also provided me access to books that motivated my own personal learning and study outside of a classroom setting. The use of the academic library instilled in me the desire to always be a life-long learner. \n\n\nPursuing a masters degree in Library and Information Science has magnified my understanding of the role libraries play in society and the good they do to communities. Each course in the degree emphasized the power and potential of libraries to provide for the cultural, economic, educational, and social well-being of communities. The \ncore competencies of an SJSU MLIS\n and the \nevidence chosen to demonstrate those competencies\n stand as evidence to this truth of the library as beacon for good. My experience in the SJSU MLIS program echoes the excitement and trust expressed by Melvil Dewey (1876) in the initial issue of \nThe American Library Journal\n:\n\n\n\n\nThe founders [of this journal] have an intense faith in the future of our libraries, and believe that if the best methods can be applied by the best librarians, the public may soon be brought to recognize our claim that the free library ranks with the free school. We hold that there is no work reaching father in its influence and deserving more honor than the work with a competent and earnest librarian can do for his [or her] community (p. 6).\n\n\n\n\nMy experiences with school libraries, public libraries, academic libraries, and pursing a masters degree in Library and Information Science demonstrate that libraries are an amazing force for good that contribute to the cultural, economic, educational, and social well-being of communities. They provide opportunities to communities and patrons that wouldn't be possible otherwise. They can also play a positive role in giving access to new technology and teaching the skills to use these technologies so that communities and patrons are active participants in today's digital world. As libraries have proved valuable to me in bridging the cultural, economic, educational, and social divides, I feel libraries can also help bridge these gaps for others. As a recipient of that help to access and learn new technologies and new ideas, I look forward to the opportunities as an employee of an academic library to serve others in bridging these gaps for themselves. \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nDewey, M.

I love learning about visual art, science, language, literature, history, geography, mathematics, music, and religion and finding ways that technology can be used to better my understanding of these subjects. The interchange of technology and liberal arts is where my interests lie. Libraries stand at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts. My progress through the \nSJSU MLIS program\n, focusing on web development, proves this to be true. \n\n\nThe courses taken in this program prepared me to achieve my dream of working with technology in an academic library. While in my second year of the program I applied for a software developer position with the \nHarold B. Lee Library\n at \nBrigham Young University (BYU)\n. Although slightly off course from my previous professional employment my technical experience combined with my MLIS coursework enabled me to get the job. Since the end of 2014 I have been working full-time as a \nData Services Engineer\n. I love my job and work with the HBLL. I work on the web development team within the library's IT division to support the library's \nvision and mission\n. Working in an academic library while finishing my masters degree has been very instructional. Courses and assignments completed in the MLIS program have helped me accomplish my web development role in the library and better understand the work of an academic library and my colleagues in the library. My work in an academic library also influences my understanding of the course material completed in the SJSU MLIS program helping me contribute to discussions and on projects. With this new perspective I am better able to contribute to the library in my position both through my web development work and through working with non-IT library staff. \n\n\nPart of my position at the HBLL includes supporting Digital Scholarship (DS) and Digital Humanities (DH) efforts. Taking a course on the Digital Humanities (INFO 220) and a course on XML (LIBR 246) motivates me to continue the pursuit of combining my love and interest for computers and technology with the efforts of the HBLL in supporting the liberal arts, DS, and DH. The web application tool \nATOM (A Table of Metadata)\n is an example of a current project that supports these kinds of academic efforts. I also plan to contribute to the academic library community in publishing and contributing to and releasing open source software projects that will benefit the larger library communities. \n\n\nWhile this conclusion marks an end to the work in the SJSU MLIS program it also marks a beginning to positively contribute my talents and learning towards bettering the HBLL and the community it serves. \n\n\nThis is my portfolio. There are many like it, but this one is mine.",
