# Competency H

The eighth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to ["demonstrate proficiency in identifying, using, and evaluating current and emerging information and communication technologies"](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/current-students/courses/core-competencies).

Societies throughout the world are experiencing rapid technological advancement. 

What was once considered science fiction is now reality. 

Computing technologies from the early 20th century that filled entire rooms and required multiple wires and cables are now available in the palm of one's hand without needing to tether the device with wires or cables. 

The rise of new networking technologies enables a level and connectivity and information access unparalleled in earth's recorded history.

Library and information scientists have played key roles in the adoption and experimentation of new technological advancements (Rubin, 2016, p. 175).

To stay relevant in a world of technological change information organizations and their staff must identify, use, and evaluate these new information and communication technologies or risk become obsolete and not able to meet the information needs of their societies and communities.

Information organizations and their staff are positioned to learn, adopt, and utilize these new technologies better than anyone else (Main, 2008, p. 149). 

New and emerging information and communication technologies include mobile computing devices, 3D printing, virtual reality (VR), blogs, wikis, RSS feeds, podcasts, instant messaging, digital photo services, software as a service, web and computer development languages and tools, mobile apps, social media, vlogs, and mash ups (Main, 2008, p. 149-158).
