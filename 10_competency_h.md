# Competency H

The eighth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to ["demonstrate proficiency in identifying, using, and evaluating current and emerging information and communication technologies"](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/current-students/courses/core-competencies). Societies throughout the world are experiencing rapid technological advancement. What was once considered science fiction is now reality. Computing technologies from the early 20th century that filled entire rooms and required multiple wires and cables are now available in the palm of one's hand without needing to tether the device with wires or cables. The rise of new networking technologies enables a level and connectivity and information access unparalleled in earth's recorded history. 

Library and information scientists have played key roles in the adoption and experimentation of new technological advancements (Rubin, 2016, p. 175). To stay relevant in a world of technological change information organizations and their staff must identify, use, and evaluate these new information and communication technologies or risk become obsolete and not able to meet the information needs of their societies and communities. Information organizations and their staff are positioned to learn, adopt, and utilize these new technologies better than anyone else (Main, 2008, p. 149). New and emerging information and communication technologies include mobile computing devices, 3D printing, virtual reality (VR), blogs, wikis, RSS feeds, podcasts, instant messaging, digital photo services, software as a service and cloud computing, web and computer development languages and tools, mobile apps, social media, vlogs, and mash ups (Main, 2008, p. 149-158; Rubin, 2016, p. 175-227). 

Identifying, using, and evaluating current and new technologies is part of one's information literacy. Identifying current and new technologies requires searching internet portals, repositories, websites, blogs, and app stores for tools and technologies that have application within an information organization. Learning to use these technologies so that their value can be evaluated requires a basic level of tool literacy to explore a technology and its ecosystem. Reading technical documentation and following online tutorials is also part of using current and new technologies. Evaluating a current or new technology involves assessing whether the technology and its capabilities matches the needs of the information organization and its clientele or patrons. Just because a technology is new or available doesn't necessarily mean an information organization must shift their focus and attention to that technology. Decisions to adopt a new technology need to be made deliberately with the focus on better serving the information organization's staff and patrons.

## Conclusion

The future is fuzzy and hard to see. Its unknown. But one thing is certain: "LIS professionals will need to be flexible and open-minded about [technology] transformations" for with new technologies comes the opportunity to "demonstrate the centrality of the library in the lives of those they serve" (Rubin, 2016, p. 226-227).
