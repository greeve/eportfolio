# Competency H

The eighth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to ["demonstrate proficiency in identifying, using, and evaluating current and emerging information and communication technologies"](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/current-students/courses/core-competencies). Societies throughout the world are experiencing rapid technological advancement. What was once considered science fiction is now reality. Computing technologies from the early 20th century that filled entire rooms and required multiple wires and cables are now available in the palm of one's hand without needing to tether the device with wires or cables. The rise of new networking technologies enables a level and connectivity and information access unparalleled in earth's recorded history. 

Library and information scientists have played key roles in the adoption and experimentation of new technological advancements (Rubin, 2016, p. 175). To stay relevant in a world of technological change information organizations and their staff must identify, use, and evaluate these new information and communication technologies or risk become obsolete and not able to meet the information needs of their societies and communities. Information organizations and their staff are positioned to learn, adopt, and utilize these new technologies better than anyone else (Main, 2008, p. 149). New and emerging information and communication technologies include mobile computing devices, 3D printing, virtual reality (VR), blogs, wikis, RSS feeds, podcasts, instant messaging, digital photo services, software as a service and cloud computing, web and computer development languages and tools, mobile apps, social media, vlogs, and mash ups (Main, 2008, p. 149-158; Rubin, 2016, p. 175-227). 

Identifying, using, and evaluating current and new technologies is part of one's information literacy. Identifying current and new technologies requires searching internet portals, repositories, websites, blogs, and app stores for tools and technologies that have application within an information organization. Learning to use these technologies so that their value can be evaluated requires a basic level of tool literacy to explore a technology and its ecosystem. Reading technical documentation and following online tutorials is also part of using current and new technologies. Evaluating a current or new technology involves assessing whether the technology and its capabilities matches the needs of the information organization and its clientele or patrons. Just because a technology is new or available doesn't necessarily mean an information organization must shift their focus and attention to that technology. Decisions to adopt a new technology need to be made deliberately with the focus on better serving the information organization's staff and patrons. Coursework and projects in the SJSU MLIS program provided to demonstrate proficiency in working with new and emerging information and communication technologies. 

## Evidence

The following evidence from previous course work demonstrates proficiency identifying, using, and evaluating current and emerging technologies.

### Projects Using Web Technologies

The SJSU MLIS program offered opportunities to learn, evaluate, and utilize web-based technologies to complete projects. The four projects listed above are examples where web-based technologies were identified, evaluated, and used to complete the project. 

A class from the SJSU MLIS program (LIBR 246) offered training and experience building websites from scratch using web technologies including HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and Javascript. The [annotated bibliography]() and [library reference guide]() for a reference services course (LIBR 210) both allowed freedom in the medium chosen to present the content. These two projects were constructed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as the web-based code repository hosting service [GitHub](https://github.com). [GitHub](https://github.com) is a website offering hosting of Git repositories. [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git) is an open source version control system (VCS). The website was hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), a feature offered through GitHub. The HTML, CSS, Javascript, and image files needed to develop these two project websites were stored in a repository on GitHub. Storing the files for the projects in Git using GitHub allowed for managing the coding and development changes as the project sites were built. Changes committed to the Git repository for the website were stored and available to see what changes were made to the repository's source code files. The Git repository also allowed for changes to be reverted if a change didn't work correctly or wasn't displaying properly in the website. The process of using HTML, CSS, javascript, and Github to create two projects helped evaluate the potential of these technologies highlighting the strengths and weaknesess of these technologies.

An instructional screencast for a reference services course (LIBR 210) demonstrated how to create a basic web map using web technologies. The screencast explored the definition of a web map, showed a few example web maps, and explained how they are created. The screencast involved utilizing the web-mapping service [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com). The screencast shows step-by-step how to sign up for a Mapbox account and create a simple web map using a [pre-created list of locations to map](http://greeve.github.io/library/guides/mapping/resources/slc_libraries.csv). The screencast also includes introductions to other technologies such as [geocoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding), [csv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), and plain text file formats. Creating this screencast required identifying, using, and evaluating these technologies to ensure that the information presented could easily be followed and understood by others wanting to use these technologies. 

The final project in an XML (Extensible Markup Language) technology class (LIBR 246) identified and used XML-based technologies. This required learning fundamental XML concepts including schema files, XML validation, and XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) and HTML. The project also provided an opportunity to learn and use the XML text editor [Oxygen](http://www.oxygenxml.com). These technologies and tools were used together to create a XML representation of a personal music collection. The XML representation could be transformed into different views of the data in HTML format. Information organizations and staff work with XML formatted data in many different contexts and settings. This final project provided experience learning and using these technologies that are still widely used throughout library and information science today. 

### [LIBR 210 Reference Tool Analysis: Goodreads]()

Social media tools have and are continuing to transform how individuals and groups interact within society. 

These tools also impact how information organizations and their staff interact with patorns and clientele.

## Conclusion

The future is fuzzy and hard to see. Its unknown. But one thing is certain: "LIS professionals will need to be flexible and open-minded about [technology] transformations" for with new technologies comes the opportunity to "demonstrate the centrality of the library in the lives of those they serve" (Rubin, 2016, p. 226-227).
