# Competency M

The thirteenth competency in the SJSU iSchool MLIS program is to ["demonstrate oral and written communication skills necessary for professional work including collaboration and presentations"](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/current-students/courses/core-competencies).

No one is their own island. We live in an interconnected world and society that requires interaction and communication. To be an active participant within this world and society requires basic literacy skills: reading, writing, and speaking. The policy manual for the American Library Association (ALA) gives emphasis to "the principle that lifelong literacy is a basic right for all individuals in our society and is essential to the welfare of the nation" (ALA Council, 2013, p. 34). Information is of no value if it cannot be communicated. The work of an information professional relies upon these fundamental literacy skills. These literacy skills enable an organization to accomplish its mission, vision, and goals in serving the organization's staff, patrons, and clientele. An organization's leadership uses these literacy skills to assess and evaluate the organization's direction and progress. They also communicate the organization's mission and vision to the organization's staff. Information professionals within the organization collaborate in meetings, on committees and projects to help further the work and progress of the organization. Information professionals interact with the organization's patrons and clientele to help meet their information needs. The success of these interactions depends upon the oral and written communication skills of the information professional.

The success of a student in the SJSU MLIS program depends upon their ability to utilize and learn literacy skills to participate in coursework and assignments. Each course in the program includes multiple assignments and projects involving reading, writing, presenting, and collaborating. Successful completion of the SJSU MLIS program can't be achieved without these fundamental skills. In addition to providing opportunities to demonstrate these literacy skills, coursework in the SJSU MLIS program acted as training ground to practice and refine these skills. The SJSU MLIS program acts as a learning laboratory to prepare students to become actively engaged information professionals.
